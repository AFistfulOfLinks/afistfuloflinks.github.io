<h2>Everything is Amazing, But Nothing is Ours</h2>
<p class="author">By Alex Danco

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot; Worlds of scarcity are made out of things. Worlds of abundance are made out of dependencies. That&rsquo;s the software playbook: find a system made of costly, redundant objects; and rearrange it into a fast, frictionless system made of logical dependencies. The delta in performance is irresistible, and dependencies are a compelling building block: they seem like just a piece of logic, with no cost and no friction. But they absolutely have a cost: the cost is complexity, outsourced agency, and brittleness. The cost of ownership is up front and visible; the cost of access is back-dated and hidden.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>SLOs Are the API for Your Engineering Team</h2>
<p class="author">By Charity Majors

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>If your job involves direct leadership of engineering teams, managing how and what they deliver, you&rsquo;ve surely come across situations where the pressure to deliver features won out and led to poor service reliability. You&rsquo;ve probably had your team&rsquo;s workflow disrupted by interference from senior managers about minor individual issues. Or, you&rsquo;ve seen or heard execs questioning your team&rsquo;s planned work to reduce technical debt or improve your delivery processes.</p>
<p>These kinds of clashes are extremely common between engineering teams and management, as well as among different engineering teams. They are all various manifestations of a single issue: the need for a better abstraction layer for people and teams who are trying to interact or collaborate with your team. That abstraction layer is called Service Level Objectives.</p>

<h2>Moving towards a faster web</h2>
<p class="author">By Chromium Blog

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Speed has been one of Chrome&rsquo;s core principles since the beginning - we&rsquo;re constantly working to give users an experience that is instant as they browse the web. That said, we have all visited web pages we thought would load fast, only to be met by an experience that could have been better. We think the web can do better and want to help users understand when a site may load slowly, while rewarding sites delivering fast experiences.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>How GitHub’s CTO Architects Engineering Teams That Scale</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;If building a high-powered engineering team is hard, successfully scaling it through hypergrowth is near impossible. So we were thrilled to welcome Jason Warner, CTO of GitHub, to speak at our Annual CTO Summit earlier this year where he shared more than a dozen discrete tips on architecting engineering teams that scale.&rdquo; </p>
