<h2>Interview advice that got me offers from Google, Microsoft, and Stripe</h2>
<p class="author">By Zain Rizvi

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google, and Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I realized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.</p>

<h2>Three crucial skills that leaders must develop to become executives</h2>
<p class="author">By Nikhyl Singhal

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Becoming a great executive requires a set of skills beyond what&rsquo;s needed to be a leader. Executive skills are subtle and can be elusive to managers, demanding a great deal of focus, courage, and dedication. These skills include taking (almost irrational) career risk, learning to scale by trusting your team, and developing advanced soft skills. New skills are hard for leaders to develop simply because they’ve already found success, which makes them less motivated to make substantive skill shifts. But those who see change as a path to growth will ascend to top roles within an organization.</p>

<h2>Driving engineering culture change at Microsoft: An experimental journey</h2>
<p class="author">By Microsoft One Engineering System Team

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Microsoft One Engineering System (1ES) team was formed in 2014, with the goal of gaining efficiencies through a common engineering tool set. Over the next few years, as progress was made, the team found that the needs of the Microsoft engineering organizations were more complex than initially perceived, leading it to broaden its efforts to encompass culture change. Today, alongside its focus on tools, the 1ES team is leading by example in driving culture change, experimenting with different approaches, building on what works, and walking away from what doesn’t. It’s focusing on areas where it can make substantial impact, engaging with teams who are ready for change, and helping them achieve it through a diversified engagement model.</p>
