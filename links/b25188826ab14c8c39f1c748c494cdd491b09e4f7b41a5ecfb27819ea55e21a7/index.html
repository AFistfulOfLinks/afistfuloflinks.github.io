<p>The Microsoft One Engineering System (1ES) team was formed in 2014, with the goal of gaining efficiencies through a common engineering tool set. Over the next few years, as progress was made, the team found that the needs of the Microsoft engineering organizations were more complex than initially perceived, leading it to broaden its efforts to encompass culture change. Today, alongside its focus on tools, the 1ES team is leading by example in driving culture change, experimenting with different approaches, building on what works, and walking away from what doesn’t. It’s focusing on areas where it can make substantial impact, engaging with teams who are ready for change, and helping them achieve it through a diversified engagement model.</p>
