<p>Virtually everywhere I&rsquo;ve ever worked has always been desperate for good engineers. The bottleneck has never been &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have enough money to hire as many engineers as we want&rdquo;, the bottleneck is always on the supply-of-good-engineering-candidates side.</p>
<p>Good engineers of course tend to be not only employed but very well paid and well-taken-care-of in just about every way. It seems like most job ads I see these days tout unlimited PTO, catered meals, etc.&mdash;things that I never would have dreamed of when I got my first real programming job in 2005 but that are practically table stakes now.</p>
<p>In order to get a good engineer to leave his or her current well-paid and perked-to-the-max job, you have to offer that person something that&rsquo;s somehow better.</p>
