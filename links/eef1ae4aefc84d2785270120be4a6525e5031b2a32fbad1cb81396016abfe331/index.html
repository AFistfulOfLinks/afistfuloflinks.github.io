<p>&ldquo;Within the past several weeks I've had the opportunity to mentor and be mentored on the topic of empowering your team while maintaining respect for RACI rules. When I look back at in my career at the times I felt most inspired by my leaders, those memorable scenarios were almost always driven through an empowerment model. The recipe for those scenarios was always the same. My team and manager was being presented with a particular challenge and I would be asked to identify the solution and then execute on that solution. Minimal manager oversight and trust played key roles. I imagine my managers all experienced some level of anxiety in allowing me to own the solution, so how did they manage the risk?&rdquo;Â </p>
