<h2>13 Things Mentally Strong People Won&#39;t Do</h2>
<p class="author">By Dr. Travis Bradberry

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We all reach critical points in our lives where our mental strength is tested. It might be a toxic friend or colleague, a dead-end job, or a struggling relationship. Whatever the challenge, you have to see things through a new lens, and take decisive action if you want to move through it successfully.</p>
<p>It sounds easy, but it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating how mentally strong people set themselves apart from the crowd. Where others see impenetrable barriers, they see challenges to overcome.</p>

<h2>A Gentle Introduction to Mutation Testing with PITest and Kotlin</h2>

<h2>Demystifying Burnout in Tech</h2>

    <p>The good news is that there <em>are</em> things we can do to both address and prevent burnout. Where we go wrong is a failure to recognize that burnout comes in many different flavors, each of which necessitates its own solution.</p>

<h2>In Defense of YAML</h2>
<p class="author">By Rod Johnson

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I'm not against YAML, just against abuse of YAML. I want to help prevent people abusing YAML and being cruel to themselves and their coworkers in the process.</p>
<p>YAML's strength is as a structured data format. Yes, it has issues. Whitespace is a minefield. Its syntax is surprisingly complex. It has gotchas: &quot;Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway.&quot; But YAML is human readable and supports comments: two key benefits that drive its popularity.</p>
<p>Where it can go wrong is where we use YAML to describe behavior.</p>

<h2>Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup: The Definitive Guide</h2>
<p class="author">By Kaiser Fung

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup is a general framework for data visualization criticism. (...) Opinion pieces on specific data graphics frequently come across as stream of conscience. Proclaiming a chart &quot;mind-blowing&quot; or &quot;worst of the century&quot; isn't worth much if the author cannot articulate why.</p>

<h2>My Unexpected Journey to Becoming a Software Tester (From Entry-level to a Manager)</h2>
<p class="author">By Mahesh C.

- Submitted by Jake Callahan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>My journey as a Software Tester started a bit unexpectedly.</p>
<p>I appeared for the initial interview rounds assuming it to be a Development opportunity. To be honest, like every other Computer Science graduate out there, I was a bit skeptical about going ahead with Testing.</p>
<p>But finally, I decided to give it a try. Only with a hope that my curious nature will help me in this field.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t accept the offer without putting up this question &ndash; Will I get an opportunity to switch to Development in case Testing doesn&rsquo;t interest me?</p>

<h2>Practical Python Programming</h2>
<p class="author">By David Beazley -

- Submitted by Jake Callahan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When I first learned Python nearly 25 years ago, I was immediately struck by how I could productively apply it to all sorts of messy work projects. Fast-forward a decade and I found myself teaching others the same fun. The result of that teaching is this course&ndash;A no-nonsense treatment of Python that has been actively taught to more than 400 in-person groups since 2007. Traders, systems admins, astronomers, tinkerers, and even a few hundred rocket scientists who used Python to help land a rover on Mars&ndash;they&rsquo;ve all taken this course. Now, I&rsquo;m pleased to make it available under a Creative Commons license. Enjoy! </p>

<h2>The End of Manual Testing</h2>
<p class="author">By Michael Bolton

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Referring to any of the testing skill sets, mindsets, and approaches as &ldquo;manual&rdquo; spectacularly misses the mark, and suggests that we&rsquo;re confused about the key body part for testing: <em>it&rsquo;s the brain, rather than the hands.</em></p>

<h2>The Ethics of Counting</h2>
<p class="author">By Deborah Stone

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Today I want to talk about this mental leap from <em>ideas</em> about social reality to <em>measures</em> of social reality, and back again to ideas. Whenever I begin to talk about this subject, people say something like, &ldquo;So you mean how to lie with statistics?&rdquo; Yes and No. (...) I will argue, instead, that statistics aren&rsquo;t born with honest meanings that people later corrupt with deceptive packaging. Numbers are figments of our imagination, <em>fictions</em> really, no more true than poems or drawings. In this sense, <em>all</em> statistics are lies.</p>

<h2>When to use the Clean Architecture?</h2>
<p class="author">By Sebastian Buczyński

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>There are few possible reactions after learning about the Clean Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture (AKA Ports &amp; Adapters) or even merely innocent service layer in Django. Some developers are enthusiastic and try to apply these techniques immediately, some are hesitant, full of doubts. The rest is strongly opposing, declaring openly this is an abomination. (...) What two extremes fail to do, is to ask the right question &ndash; WHEN? <strong>When the Clean Architecture should be used?</strong> </p>
