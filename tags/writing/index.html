<h2>Delivering on an architecture strategy</h2>
<p class="author">By Pete Hodgson

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Software companies always have an unended stream of product features for engineers to work on. One of the most important responsibilities of a technology leader is to carve out space so that engineers can also perform the technical work which keeps the architectural foundations of a product healthy. Just as product leadership are responsible for defining a vision for a product and leading towards it, tech leadership is responsible for defining a vision for architecture, and leading towards that.</p>

<h2>Kubernetes: Core Concepts</h2>
<p class="author">By Tom Gallacher

- Submitted by Vatsal Parekh

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Getting to grips with Kubernetes can be extremely difficult, with so much information floating around on the seas of the internet, it is sometimes very difficult to find the &ldquo;core&rdquo; pieces of information to understand Kubernetes, especially when seeing how dense the information is on kubernetes.io&rsquo;s concepts pages and documentation. In part one of this &ldquo;Kubernetes&rdquo; blog series, we will explore the core concepts of Kubernetes to gain a base level of knowledge, so that we can together demystify Kubernetes.</p>

<h2>On Pair Programming</h2>
<p class="author">By Martin Fowler

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many people who work in software development today have heard of the practice of pair programming, yet it still only has patchy adoption in the industry. One reason for its varying acceptance is that its benefits are not immediately obvious, it pays off more in the medium- and long-term. And it's also not as simple as &quot;two people working at a single computer&quot;, so many dismiss it quickly when it feels uncomfortable. However, in our experience, pair programming is vital for collaborative teamwork and high-quality software.</p>

<h2>The Complete Guide to Effective Reading</h2>
<p class="author">By Maarten van Doorn

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Learning is a heavily misunderstood concept.</p>
<p>As a paradigm example of deep work, we understand that, when reading, directing your full attention to the material at hand is essential. Grasping complex information is hard.</p>
<p>But this is only half the battle.</p>
<p>After some string of words hits your retina and made its way to your brain, you&rsquo;re not done.</p>
<p>In a cruel irony, these hours of deep work often cause flow states and the feeling that &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve had a good day&rsquo; and learned a shitload of new stuff.</p>
<p>But for many reading episodes this feeling is deceptive. There is an ineliminable aspect to learning that takes place after the glorious flow state.</p>
<p>The other half of the battle is to transfer the newly acquired intelligence from your working memory to your long-term understanding and integrate it into your standing stack of mental models.</p>

    <p>OKRs work well on a corporate level, they are great for visualizing common objectives and outcomes and getting everyone moving in the same direction. But our corporate level is very nimble, it has to be. So our objectives change fast and adapting iterated OKRs on multiple levels all the way to the individual consumed time and energy that we just couldn&rsquo;t afford that often.</p>
