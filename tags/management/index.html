<h2>5 Pillars of a Successful Test Automation Implementation</h2>
<p class="author">By Bas Dijkstra

- Submitted by Eric L Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Discussions on what constitutes a &ldquo;proper implementation&rdquo; of test automation often focus on what tool you should use, but that is only one part of the equation. Bas Djikstra details four other things you should consider, how they contribute to the success of your test automation, and what risks are associated with failing to pay proper attention to each of them.</p>

<h2>5 Ways to Optimize Tests for Continuous Integration</h2>
<p class="author">By John Ruberto

    <p>Many teams have existing automated test suites that are not included in a continuous integration program. Maybe the tests take too long to execute, or they are not reliable enough to give accurate results. Here&rsquo;s how to assess your test suites in terms of value added and time to execute, along with five proven strategies to optimize those suites for CI.</p>

<h2>6 Steps Leaders Can Take to Get the Most Out of Feedback</h2>
<p class="author">By Jennifer Porter

- Submitted by Karel Piwko

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Business publications are filled with articles about feedback: how important it is for leaders, how leaders can both give and receive it, what happens when leaders don&rsquo;t get it, and even what to do if someone is not open to feedback they have been given. The focus tends to be on the transfer of data.</p>
<p>What is less explored is how leaders should respond once they receive that data. Through our work coaching thousands of leaders across industries, my colleagues and I have found that, even when leaders make an effort to collect robust feedback, they only access about 25% of its potential value.</p>

<h2>Advice: What to do when you’re a woman and a man ignores you in a meeting</h2>
<p class="author">By Robin Abrahams

- Submitted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cswiii" class="submitter">Corey Welton</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A younger, male colleague and I were recently assessing a university unit as volunteers for a professional association. We met with two supervising faculty, an older man (Professor X) and a woman about my age. Throughout the meeting X angled himself toward my colleague, and rarely let the other woman answer any questions. At the end, he asked my colleague questions about his background, but did not ask me, a woman, about mine. What did I do to render myself invisible or less powerful? Does taking notes in a steno pad make me appear to be a secretary? I asked my share of questions, but not the first question. Was that a mistake? Was I right to just let it go and use it as a teachable moment with my students?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A peculiar challenge of management is trying to invest in someone's career development when they themselves are uncertain about their goals. As a manager, you may have more experience and more access to opportunities within the company, but that represents a small slice of someone's career possibilities. Our schooling often rewards us for being methodical, linear thinkers, but that approach is less effective outside the intentionally constrained possibility spaces.</p>

<h2>Cheap Stuff To Hack: A Router With An SDR For $13</h2>

    <p>The history of consumer electronics is littered with devices that are relatively uninteresting at first, but become spectacular platforms for hardware exploitation once a few select people figure out how everything ticks.

<p>Now there&rsquo;s a new device sitting on the shelves at Walmart just waiting for some Linux hackers to have a go. It&rsquo;s the Tzumi MagicTV, a device that allows you to watch over-the-air television on your phone.</p>

Your initial instinct might be to roll up your sleeves. &ldquo;Time to be the boss,&rdquo; you think to yourself. You&rsquo;re ready to step in, solve the problem and save the day.\</p>
<p>Or something like that. You just want to be helpful.\</p>

<h2>On Being a Senior Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By John Allspaw

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>What does it actually mean to be &lsquo;senior&rsquo; in this discipline? I certainly have an opinion of what it means, given that I&rsquo;m charged with hiring, supporting, and retaining engineers whom are deemed to be senior. This notion that there is a bar to be passed in terms of career development is a good one, but I&rsquo;d also add that these criteria exist on a spectrum, as opposed to a simple list of check-boxes. You don&rsquo;t wake up one day and you are &ldquo;senior&rdquo; just because your title reflects that upon a promotion. Senior engineers don&rsquo;t know everything. They&rsquo;re not perfect in their technical knowledge, and they&rsquo;re OK with that.</p>

<h2>Participating in Code Reviews as a Tester</h2>
<p class="author">By Chris Kenst

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Code reviews are a popular method of catching bugs early in development through peer-reviewing someone&rsquo;s code. But perhaps more important than catching bugs, these reviews also serve as a chance to see how something is built and have a conversation about it. Because testers question software differently from developers, it&rsquo;s important that we participate in this knowledge-sharing practice.</p>

<h2>Rather Than a Micromanager or Absentee Manager, Be a Thought Partner</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;We call managers who have low, almost non-existent involvement in their team&rsquo;s work absentee managers. Those with extremely (maybe excruciatingly) close involvement are micromanagers. And in between those are the thought partners, the ones who empower, enable and encourage their teams to do the best work of their lives. How can you determine where you fall on this spectrum so you can learn how to move in the right direction instead of being a micromanager or an absentee manager?</p>

<h2>The Singleton Pattern</h2>
<p class="author">By Brandon Rhodes

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Python programmers almost never implement the Singleton Pattern as described in the Gang of Four book, whose Singleton class forbids normal instantiation and instead offers a class method that returns the singleton instance. Python is more elegant, and lets a class continue to support the normal syntax for instantiation while defining a custom __new__() method that returns the singleton instance. But an even more Pythonic approach, if your design forces you to offer global access to a singleton object, is to use The Global Object Pattern instead.&rdquo; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is a bunch of reasons that make the transition to management so hard, the initial months can be a real struggle for those without experience. Understanding the issues is the initial step to handle with it, so let's talk about some of the reasons why it feels so hard to make the jump.</p>

<h2>Trick Yourself Into Creating a Fresh Start</h2>
<p class="author">By Ashley Abramson

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>It happens every year: With the turn of a calendar page comes a feeling of hope and opportunity, a renewed determination to tackle goals that have been on the back burner, plus some new ones for good measure. But then a month goes by, and then another, and that ambition slowly fades as you settle back into your ruts. And barring any huge change on the horizon, like a new job or a cross-country move, that&rsquo;s likely where you&rsquo;ll stay until a new year starts and the cycle repeats.</p>

<h2>Two Measures of Development Effectiveness: Predictability and Optimization</h2>
<p class="author">By Neil Fox

- Submitted by Eric L Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Nearly every CIO or VP of R&amp;D is struggling to improve their time to market while increase the number of features delivered within stagnant or shrinking budgets. Two objectives of software development teams will address this need are to improve predictability and optimize productivity By combining views of predictability and productivity of the development activity, the team and its stakeholders can quickly and easily tell if the development is on track, if predictability is improving, and if team members are self-aware enough to improve their overall output.</p>

    <p>I found this article very interesting, as it touches on writing automated tests for valid states only and not worry about states that theoretically would never be allowed by a function. What is your take? </p>

<h2>Useful pytest command line options</h2>
<p class="author">By Leonardo Giordani

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I recently gave a workshop on &quot;TDD in Python with pytest&quot;, where I developed a very simple Python project together with the attendees following a TDD approach. It's a good way to introduce TDD, I think. I wrote each test together with the attendees, and then I left them the task of writing the Python code that passes the test. This way I could show TDD in action, introducing pytest features like the pytest.raises context manager or the use of assert while they become useful for the actual tests.</p>

<h2>Who Are the Forgotten Greats of Science Fiction?</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Time is nobody&rsquo;s friend. Authors in particular can fall afoul of time&mdash;all it takes is a few years out of the limelight. Publishers will let their books fall out of print; readers will forget about them. Replace &ldquo;years&rdquo; with &ldquo;decades&rdquo; and authors can become very obscure indeed.</p>

<h2>Why Do Employees Resist Change?</h2>
<p class="author">By Paul Strebel

- Submitted by <a href="https://mirekdlugosz.com/" class="submitter">Miroslaw Dlugosz-Zalewski</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The scenario is all too familiar. Company leaders talk about total quality management, downsizing, or customer value. Determined managers follow up with plans for process improvements in customer service, manufacturing, and supply chain management, and for new organizations to fit the new processes. From subordinates, management looks for enthusiasm, acceptance, and commitment. But it gets something less. Communication breaks down, implementation plans miss their mark, and results fall short. This happens often enough that we have to ask why, and how we can avoid these failures.</p>

<h2>Why I Left Management: the engineering technical track vs. management track</h2>
<p class="author">By Joy Ebertz

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When advancing in an engineering career, at some point, the question will come up of if you&rsquo;re interested in the technical track or the management track. Different people thrive on different tracks and many people move back and forth between the two, some of them multiple times. While at many companies, good engineers are promoted to become engineering managers, the jobs are actually very different, and it&rsquo;s worth considering what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into and if it&rsquo;s a position in which you can thrive. As I made the transition into management and ultimately back, I learned some things about myself and how I operate.</p>

<h2>Why you should stop using Git rebase</h2>
<p class="author">By Fredrik V. Mørken

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>After using Git for several years, I found myself gradually using more and more advanced Git commands as part of my daily workflow. Soon after I discovered Git rebase, I quickly incorporated it into my daily workflow. Those who are familiar with rebasing know how powerful a tool it is, and how tempting it is to use it all the time. However, I soon discovered that rebasing presents some challenges that are not obvious when you first start doing it. Before presenting them, I&rsquo;ll quickly recap the differences between merging and rebasing.</p>

<h2>Working With JSON Data in Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Lukas Lofaro

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Since its inception, JSON has quickly become the de facto standard for information exchange. Chances are you&rsquo;re here because you need to transport some data from here to there. Perhaps you&rsquo;re gathering information through an API or storing your data in a document database. One way or another, you&rsquo;re up to your neck in JSON, and you&rsquo;ve got to Python your way out.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is a pretty common task, and&mdash;as with most common tasks&mdash;Python makes it almost disgustingly easy. Have no fear, fellow Pythoneers and Pythonistas. This one&rsquo;s gonna be a breeze!</p>

<h2>Your favorite writers, ranked by height</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to write this list. I wasn&rsquo;t going to, but then I mentioned it, half-joking, in the Literary Hub office. Turns out everyone was extremely excited about finding out how tall their favorite writers were (or are). Who knew, right? Anyway, I decided to do it after all. Because it is fun. If you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fun, well, I don&rsquo;t have to explain my art to you.</p>
