<h2>All You Need to Know to Start Using Fixtures in Your pytest Code</h2>
<p class="author">By Bob

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Setting up test cases for code that manage data can be challenging but it's an important skill to reliably test your code. You might have heard of the setup and teardown methods in unittest. In pytest you use fixtures and as you will discover in this article they are actually not that hard to set up. Fixtures have been labelled pytest's killer feature so let's explore them in this article using a practical example.</p>

<h2>Another Side of-- Scott Fitzgerald?</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Do you remember your first F. Scott Fitzgerald? How you realized there was something more to literature, a voice, a time, a glamor? And then you heard about Zelda, and the Jazz Age, and Gatsby, and the beautiful shirts? And thought about why Nick Carraway was named that, and what Scott&rsquo;s life was really like, and whether it would have been amazing or tragic?<br>
Sally Koslow explored, absorbed, researched and recreated&mdash;and brings us&mdash;lucky us&mdash;a wonderful narrative biography into one part of Scott Fitzgerald&rsquo;s life.</p>

<h2>Breaking the Test Case Addiction (Part 3)</h2>
<p class="author">By Michael Bolton

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In <a href="https://www.developsense.com/blog/2019/01/breaking-the-test-case-addiction-part-1/">the previous post</a>, &ldquo;Frieda&rdquo;, my coaching client, asked about producing test cases for auditors or regulators. In Rapid Software Testing (RST), we find it helpful to frame that in terms of formal testing.</p>
<p>Testing is formal to the degree that it must be done in a specific way, or to verify specific facts. Formal testing typically has the goal of confirming or demonstrating something in particular about the product. There&rsquo;s a continuum to testing formality in RST.</p>

<h2>How This 5-Word Philosophy Can Transform Your Leadership Ability</h2>

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We're several months into the work at the firm, and one very interesting concept has come to the fore: The implementation of preemptive change is about desire. Or, as one senior leader proffered at a recent executive steering committee meeting, &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it.&quot; I love this statement: &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it!&quot; It's a straightforward way to summarize an otherwise elegant management philosophy -- one that connotes desire, focus, and a commitment to change. In the interest of furthering this theory, let me propose five basic leadership principles we can use to form the backbone of the &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it&quot; philosophy. </p>

<h2>Monkeypatching with pytest</h2>
<p class="author">By Patrick Kennedy

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Monkeypatching is dynamically changing a piece of software (such as a module, object, method, or function) at runtime. Monkeypatching is often used for bug fixes or prototyping software, especially when using external APIs or libraries. Pytest uses this feature to allow you to test out interfaces that you don&rsquo;t want to actually execute. For example, you can create a monkeypatched version of the requests module that doesn&rsquo;t do the actual HTTP transactions during testing, but just returns fixed data that you set.</p>

<h2>On Being a Senior Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By John Allspaw

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>What does it actually mean to be &lsquo;senior&rsquo; in this discipline? I certainly have an opinion of what it means, given that I&rsquo;m charged with hiring, supporting, and retaining engineers whom are deemed to be senior. This notion that there is a bar to be passed in terms of career development is a good one, but I&rsquo;d also add that these criteria exist on a spectrum, as opposed to a simple list of check-boxes. You don&rsquo;t wake up one day and you are &ldquo;senior&rdquo; just because your title reflects that upon a promotion. Senior engineers don&rsquo;t know everything. They&rsquo;re not perfect in their technical knowledge, and they&rsquo;re OK with that.</p>

<h2>Rating the Severity of Usability Problems</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>If only one out of 1000 users encounters a problem with a website, then it&rsquo;s a minor problem.</p>
<p>If that sentence bothered you, it should.</p>
<p>It could be that that single problem resulted in one visitor&rsquo;s financial information inadvertently being posted to the website for the world to see.</p>
<p>Or it could be a slight hesitation with a label on an obscure part of a website.</p>

<h2>Screaming Architecture</h2>
<p class="author">By Uncle Bob

- Submitted by <a href="https://elyezer.com/" class="submitter">Elyezer Rezende</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A good software architecture allows decisions about frameworks, databases, web-servers, and other environmental issues and tools, to be deferred and delayed. A good architecture makes it unnecessary to decide on Rails, or Spring, or Hibernate, or Tomcat or MySql, until much later in the project. A good architecture makes it easy to change your mind about those decisions too. A good architecture emphasizes the use-cases and decouples them from peripheral concerns. </p>

<h2>Taming Irreversibility with Feature Flags (in Python)</h2>

    <p>Feature Flags are a very simple technique to make features of your application quickly toggleable.
