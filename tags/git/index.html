<h2>Career narratives</h2>
<p class="author">By Will Larson

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A peculiar challenge of management is trying to invest in someone's career development when they themselves are uncertain about their goals. As a manager, you may have more experience and more access to opportunities within the company, but that represents a small slice of someone's career possibilities. Our schooling often rewards us for being methodical, linear thinkers, but that approach is less effective outside the intentionally constrained possibility spaces.</p>

<h2>Completing this 30-minute exercise makes teams less anxious and more productive</h2>
<p class="author">By Leah Fessler

<blockquote>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a funny thing about work: We spend more time with our colleagues than with our friends and family. Yet more often than not, we don&rsquo;t really understand our co-workers&mdash;because being honest with one another is scary.</p>

<h2>How to ask good questions</h2>
<p class="author">By Julia Evans

- Submitted by Kersom Moura Oliveira

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Asking good questions is a super important skill when writing software. I&rsquo;ve gotten way better at it over the years (to the extent that it&rsquo;s something my coworkers comment on a lot). Here are a few guidelines that have worked well for me!</p>

<h2>Why you should stop using Git rebase</h2>
<p class="author">By Fredrik V. MÃ¸rken

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>After using Git for several years, I found myself gradually using more and more advanced Git commands as part of my daily workflow. Soon after I discovered Git rebase, I quickly incorporated it into my daily workflow. Those who are familiar with rebasing know how powerful a tool it is, and how tempting it is to use it all the time. However, I soon discovered that rebasing presents some challenges that are not obvious when you first start doing it. Before presenting them, I&rsquo;ll quickly recap the differences between merging and rebasing.</p>

<h2>Your favorite writers, ranked by height</h2>
<p class="author">By Emily Temple

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to write this list. I wasn&rsquo;t going to, but then I mentioned it, half-joking, in the Literary Hub office. Turns out everyone was extremely excited about finding out how tall their favorite writers were (or are). Who knew, right? Anyway, I decided to do it after all. Because it is fun. If you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fun, well, I don&rsquo;t have to explain my art to you.</p>
