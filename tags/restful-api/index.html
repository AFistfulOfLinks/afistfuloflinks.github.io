<h2>API/REST testing like Chuck Norris with pytest play using YAML</h2>
<p class="author">By Davide Moro

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In this article we will see how to write HTTP API tests with pytest using YAML files thanks to pytest-play &gt;= 2.0.0 (pytest-play provides support for Selenium, MQTT, SQL and more. See third party pytest-play plugins).</p>
<p>The guest star is Chuck Norris thanks to the public JSON endpoint available at <a href="https://api.chucknorris.io/">api.chucknorris.io</a> so you will be able to run your test by your own following this example.</p>

<h2>Becoming a team lead: a survival guide</h2>
<p class="author">By Joseph Wynn

- Submitted by <a href="https://elyezer.com/" class="submitter">Elyezer Rezende</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The reason this is a survival guide is because after spending my entire career as a software engineer, I was thrown into a team lead role without much warning. I had no idea what I was doing and had very little support. This is the survival guide I wish I had. It documents my experiences as an inexperienced team lead &ndash;as an engineer transitioning to a team lead&ndash; and my learnings &amp; mistakes along the way. Hopefully this can act as a survival guide for you, too. </p>

<h2>Breaking the Test Case Addiction (Part 6)</h2>
<p class="author">By Michael Bolton

- Submitted by <a href="https://mirekdlugosz.com/" class="submitter">Miroslaw Zalewski</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the last installment, we ended by asking &ldquo;Once the tester has learned something about the product, how can you focus a tester&rsquo;s work without over-focusing it?</p>
<p>I provided some examples in Part 4 of this series. Here&rsquo;s another: scenario testing. The examples I&rsquo;ll provide here are based on work done by James Bach and Geordie Keitt several years ago. (I&rsquo;ve helped several other organizations apply this approach much more recently, but they&rsquo;re less willing to share details.)</p>
<p>The idea is to use scenarios to guide the tester to explore, experiment, and get experience with the product, acting on ideas about real-world use and about how the product might foreseeably be misused.</p>

<h2>From Software Engineer to Engineering Manager</h2>
<p class="author">By David Chua

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A year ago, all engineers at ShopBack reported directly to the CTO. We had no Engineering Managers (EM), no team leads, and in other words &mdash; no structure. Recognising this as a rising issue for a start-up with a 250% year-on-year growth rate, we hired a VP Engineering to put a proper structure in place.</p>
<p>Introducing engineering managers was a paradigm shift he proposed which had an outsized impact on the engineering team.</p>

<h2>Generating Random Data in Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Brad Solomon

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>How random is random? This is a weird question to ask, but it is one of paramount importance in cases where information security is concerned. Whenever you&rsquo;re generating random data, strings, or numbers in Python, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have at least a rough idea of how that data was generated.</p>

<h2>How to design a RESTful API architecture from a human-language spec</h2>
<p class="author">By Filipe XimenesFlávio Juvenal

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Like almost all software, an API needs to reflect the needs of the humans who interact with it. An API is somewhat different from a GUI or other user interface because it interacts with a programmer rather than directly with the end user. However, the principles of designing for the user still apply: you must think of the background knowledge brought by the programmers and the constraints under which they are operating, such as the bandwidth of mobile devices.</p>

<h2>On Being a Principal Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By Silvia Botros

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>One of the most common steps in defining titles when a company is hitting its growth stage is adding &lsquo;Senior&rsquo; to the moniker of engineer but soon enough, especially if retention is good and people are staying on board a number of years, companies realize they need more than just a 2 level engineering ladder. This is where titles like &lsquo;principal&rsquo; or &lsquo;staff&rsquo; engineer become part of the defined career ladder. However, principal engineer should not be seen as a natural progression to senior engineering levels.</p>

<h2>Participating in Code Reviews as a Tester</h2>
<p class="author">By Chris Kenst

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Code reviews are a popular method of catching bugs early in development through peer-reviewing someone&rsquo;s code. But perhaps more important than catching bugs, these reviews also serve as a chance to see how something is built and have a conversation about it. Because testers question software differently from developers, it&rsquo;s important that we participate in this knowledge-sharing practice.</p>

<h2>REST vs. GraphQL: A Critical Review</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Are you building an API? Here is the idea: If you have never heard about the REST architectural style constraints and their implication on the properties of the resulting distributed system and you do not want to (or can&rsquo;t) educate yourself, use GraphQL. </p>

<h2>Say the Hard Thing</h2>

<h2>Testing Microservices, the sane way</h2>
<p class="author">By Cindy Sridharan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The ability to develop, deploy and scale different business functionality independently is one of the most touted benefits of adopting a microservices architecture. While the jury&rsquo;s still out on if these benefits really check out or not, microservices are very much in vogue, to the point where this architecture has now become the default of even many startups. Yet when it comes to testing (or worse, when developing) microservices, most organizations seem to be quite attached to an antediluvian model of testing all components in unison.</p>

<h2>The human scalability of “DevOps”</h2>
