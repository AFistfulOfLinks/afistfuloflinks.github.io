<h2>7 absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer</h2>

    <p>In reflecting on this first decade of getting regularly paid money to type weird symbols into my Terminal, I wanted to take some time to share some of the ways my thinking shifted over the years as a developer.</p>
<p><strong>For today&rsquo;s junior developers:</strong> Maybe you&rsquo;ll find something here you currently believe, and get inspired to learn more about it and why the topic is so multi-faceted. Or maybe you&rsquo;ll find this post encouraging because you&rsquo;re already so far ahead of where I was at your stage.</p>

<h2>Career narratives</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A peculiar challenge of management is trying to invest in someone's career development when they themselves are uncertain about their goals. As a manager, you may have more experience and more access to opportunities within the company, but that represents a small slice of someone's career possibilities. Our schooling often rewards us for being methodical, linear thinkers, but that approach is less effective outside the intentionally constrained possibility spaces.</p>

<h2>Colossal Cave Adventure: Building and running 40-year-old code from the dawn of gaming</h2>
<p class="author">By Doug Tidewell

    <blockquote>
<p>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.<br>
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building<br>
and down a gully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar? If you&rsquo;re an old-school gamer, you&rsquo;ve probably seen these words hundreds of times. They&rsquo;re the starting point for Colossal Cave Adventure, the first major computer game. It was created in 1977 by Willie Crowther and Don Woods and quickly became a phenomenon in those pre-GUI, pre-Internet years. What helped the game spread from one data center to another was the fact that the source code was freely available.</p>
<p>The last version of the code from the original authors was written in 1995, and if you&rsquo;re like us, you're hearing this story and wondering where that code is now. With the encouragement and permission of the authors, open source pioneer Eric S. Raymond has ported the code to his GitLab account. In this article, we&rsquo;ll show you how to build and run that code.</p>

<h2>Deploying a Flask app using AWS</h2>

    <p>In this blog we will create a basic Flask application and deploy this to the web using AWS Lambda. The application is a simple API that takes as input some user defined data and posts the output. The inputs will also be saved to a database using AWS RDS.</p>
<p>Our simple API will calculate the roots of a given quadratic equation. It will take as input three numerical values which represent the coefficients and calculate the values (if they exist). We will also add in a way to store a record of these values in a database.</p>

    <p>Most websites these days are Single Page Applications (SPA for short) where a single entry file handles all routes that a user might visit. Swept up in the ongoing trend of hosting in the cloud you might find yourself needing to &ldquo;dockerize&rdquo; your SPA. That is to say wrap it inside a Docker image and run it as a container.

<h2>Generating castles for Minecraft™ using Haskell</h2>

    <p>&ldquo;My kids and I have enjoyed building various structures in the game Minecraft, but it can get rather monotonous placing blocks one-at-a-time. I took a very brief look at the custom &ldquo;mods&rdquo; available, but wanted something more compositional, hence the idea for a Haskell DSL was born. The aim is to build a skeleton structure, thereby eliminating the most repetitive parts of manual construction, for example walls, floors, roofs etc. We can then enjoy furnishing the structures by hand in the actual game.&rdquo; </p>

    <p>On the outset of the study, the team hypothesized that distributed teams might not be as productive as their centrally located counterparts. &ldquo;We were a little nervous about that,&rdquo; says Gilrane. She was surprised to find that distributed teams performed just as well. Unfortunately, she also found that there is a lot more frustration involved in working remotely. Workers in other offices can sometimes feel burdened to sync up their schedules with the main office. They can also feel disconnected from the team.</p>

    <p>Matplotlib and Seaborn are some nice libraries in Python to create great looking plots. But these plots are all static and it&rsquo;s hard to depict the change of data values in a dynamic and pleasingly looking way. How nice would it be if in you next presentation, video or social media post you can present development in the data by using a short video clip? And even better, you can still keep using Matplotlib, Seaborn or any other library that you like to use for your plots!</p>

<h2>How to Get Regression Defects Under Control</h2>
<p class="author">By Kathryn Nest

- Submitted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cswiii" class="submitter">Corey Welton</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Regression defects can be the most frustrating thing in the software world.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what that means, exactly, or you don&rsquo;t have direct experience with it, let me set the stage for you. Your team has been working on a software release for months. It&rsquo;s been something of a grind, and you&rsquo;ve had to cut a few corners to go live by your deadline, but you&rsquo;re going to ship on time. Sure, you anticipate some glitches, but at least you didn&rsquo;t fail to deliver.</p>
<p>You ship the software and, sure enough, reports of glitches do come in. And, as you anticipated, these have to do with the new functionality you developed. Er, some of them do, anyway.</p>
<p>But there are a bunch of other problems besides. And these don&rsquo;t seem to have anything to do with what you shipped. Users are reporting bugs in things that have always worked since the day you&rsquo;ve developed them. And they&rsquo;re understandably not happy about this.</p>
<p>These are regression defects.</p>

    <p>One common question for software developers is how to progress from 'intermediate' to 'senior'&mdash;whatever those titles mean.

<h2>Lessons learned managing the GitLab Data team</h2>
<p class="author">By Taylor A. Murphy

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>From April 2018 to May 2019 I was the manager of the Data team for GitLab. I took this role after my manager left, when I started reporting directly to the CFO as a Data Engineer. I remember saying to him &quot;this doesn't seem like the right level of abstraction for you,&quot; and proposed I step up to become the manager. I also said I didn't want to do this for a long period of time, since I intentionally came to GitLab to move from a manager role to an individual contributor role and focus on Data Engineering. What follows are a few lessons I learned (and relearned!) in my one-year stint as the manager of the Data team. Eventually, I aim to become a manager again and I hope to remember these lessons and learn even more. </p>

<h2>Why you should stop using Git rebase</h2>
<p class="author">By Fredrik V. Mørken

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>After using Git for several years, I found myself gradually using more and more advanced Git commands as part of my daily workflow. Soon after I discovered Git rebase, I quickly incorporated it into my daily workflow. Those who are familiar with rebasing know how powerful a tool it is, and how tempting it is to use it all the time. However, I soon discovered that rebasing presents some challenges that are not obvious when you first start doing it. Before presenting them, I&rsquo;ll quickly recap the differences between merging and rebasing.</p>

<h2>Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.</h2>

    <p>I would much rather have 30 tests break all at once due to one bug because they're integration tests than have no tests break because I mostly unit tested and didn't consider testing a specific integration point.</p>

<h2>Yes, You Should Estimate Software Projects</h2>
<p class="author">By Gergely Orosz

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;I hear more voices saying there is little point in doing time-based estimations on how long building software will take, and thus we should just stop doing it. &quot;Let's just use story points and estimate complexity, but not the time&quot; and &quot;Let's just try #noestimates&quot; are suggestions people around me recently brought up. I'm personally skeptical of both approaches. While I do think that doing time-based estimates is really hard, it comes with so many benefits for those who keep doing it.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Your favorite writers, ranked by height</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to write this list. I wasn&rsquo;t going to, but then I mentioned it, half-joking, in the Literary Hub office. Turns out everyone was extremely excited about finding out how tall their favorite writers were (or are). Who knew, right? Anyway, I decided to do it after all. Because it is fun. If you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fun, well, I don&rsquo;t have to explain my art to you.</p>

<h2>Your Productivity Hinges on How You Arrange Your Desk</h2>
<p class="author">By Alli Hoff Kosik

- Submitted by Daniel Gur

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>If your job requires you to sit at a desk, you probably spend more waking hours at that desk each day than you do in your own home (or in any other part of your home, if that&rsquo;s where you work from). If you love your job, this may not seem like such a bad thing, but it&rsquo;s still worth maximizing your small space for ultimate productivity.<br>
We asked design and productivity experts for advice on how best to structure, organize, and decorate your desk to create a workspace that serves you, keeps you on task, and makes you feel good about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<h2>Your Professional Growth Questionnaire</h2>
<p class="author">By &#34;Rands&#34;

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For many of the companies I&rsquo;ve worked at for the past three decades, performance season is three weeks once a year. More progressive companies have a major performance cycle per year with a minor one six months after the major to capture one-off promotions for exceptional, errors in job leveling at hiring, and other performance housekeeping tasks that can&rsquo;t wait another six months.</p>
