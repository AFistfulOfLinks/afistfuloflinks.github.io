<h2>Breaking the Test Case Addiction (Part 5)</h2>
<p class="author">By Michael Bolton

- Submitted by <a href="https://mirekdlugosz.com/" class="submitter">Miroslaw Zalewski</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In Rapid Software Testing, we say that testing is evaluating a product by learning about it through exploration and experimentation, which includes questioning, modeling, studying, manipulating, making inferences, etc. So learning is an essential part of testing. There are lots of artifacts and people that testers could interact with to start learning about the product, which I&rsquo;ve discussed already. Let&rsquo;s look at why making a tester work through test cases might not be such a good approach.</p>

<h2>Delivering on an architecture strategy</h2>
<p class="author">By Pete Hodgson

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Software companies always have an unended stream of product features for engineers to work on. One of the most important responsibilities of a technology leader is to carve out space so that engineers can also perform the technical work which keeps the architectural foundations of a product healthy. Just as product leadership are responsible for defining a vision for a product and leading towards it, tech leadership is responsible for defining a vision for architecture, and leading towards that.</p>

    <p>Habits are algorithms operating in the background that power our lives. Good habits help us reach our goals more effectively and efficiently. Bad ones makes things harder or prevent success entirely. Habits powerfully influence our automatic behavior.</p>

<h2>I’ve Interviewed 300 High Achievers About Their Morning Routines. Here’s What I’ve Learned</h2>
<p class="author">By Benjamin Spall

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The choices we make during the first hour or so of our morning often determine what the rest of the day will look like. Will your morning routine grant you a day full of productivity and peace of mind? Or will you be looking at an eight-hour stretch of haphazard work?</p>

<h2>On Pair Programming</h2>
<p class="author">By Martin Fowler

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many people who work in software development today have heard of the practice of pair programming, yet it still only has patchy adoption in the industry. One reason for its varying acceptance is that its benefits are not immediately obvious, it pays off more in the medium- and long-term. And it's also not as simple as &quot;two people working at a single computer&quot;, so many dismiss it quickly when it feels uncomfortable. However, in our experience, pair programming is vital for collaborative teamwork and high-quality software.</p>

<h2>The Art of Active Listening</h2>
<p class="author">By Glenna Fulks

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many of us are guilty of starting a conversation and putting a thought or question out there. Instead of giving the other individual time to formulate a response, we immediately re-phrase the question or remark and answer it ourselves. In other words, we don&rsquo;t give ourselves a chance to listen since we never stop talking.</p>

<h2>The state of Python Packaging</h2>
<p class="author">By Bernat Gabor

- Submitted by Elijah DeLee

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>pip 19.0 has been released on 22nd January 2019. On the feature list most notably it now supports PEP-517, which by default is turned on when that the project has a pyproject.toml at the root folder. The PEP in question has been created in 2015 and accepted in 2017. Even though it took a while until pip implemented it, the release and the issues that followed it up confirmed that many people are not at all familiar with it. Read on if you want to get a picture of how the Python packaging ecosystem evolved as of today and where we hope to see it down the line. We hope even though the introduction of aforementioned python enhancement proposal may cause some discomfort at the moment, we will benefit from it in the long term.</p>
