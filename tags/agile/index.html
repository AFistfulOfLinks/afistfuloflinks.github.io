<h2>5 Pillars of a Successful Test Automation Implementation</h2>
<p class="author">By Bas Dijkstra

    <p>Discussions on what constitutes a &ldquo;proper implementation&rdquo; of test automation often focus on what tool you should use, but that is only one part of the equation. Bas Djikstra details four other things you should consider, how they contribute to the success of your test automation, and what risks are associated with failing to pay proper attention to each of them.</p>

<h2>5 Ways to Optimize Tests for Continuous Integration</h2>
<p class="author">By John Ruberto

    <p>Many teams have existing automated test suites that are not included in a continuous integration program. Maybe the tests take too long to execute, or they are not reliable enough to give accurate results. Here&rsquo;s how to assess your test suites in terms of value added and time to execute, along with five proven strategies to optimize those suites for CI.</p>

<h2>Agile Without Dedicated QA</h2>
<p class="author">By James Shore

- Submitted by Jan Krocil

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the early days of Agile, methods such as Extreme Programming advocated for shipping without a QA phase. In fact, they often didn’t have dedicated testers—or even bug-tracking systems. And yet there are stories of these teams producing an order of magnitude fewer defects than normal. What did these teams do, and why did it work? And what role does that leave for QA? In an age where Agile is interpreted to mean “sprints” and “story points,” the technical side of Agile is often forgotten. In this invited talk for the October 2019 Pacific Northwest Software Conference, I spoke about the technical underpinnings of Agile and how they lead to true business agility.</p>

Two objectives of software development teams will address this need are to improve predictability and optimize productivity By combining views of predictability and productivity of the development activity, the team and its stakeholders can quickly and easily tell if the development is on track, if predictability is improving, and if team members are self-aware enough to improve their overall output.</p>
