<h2>Building a QA team (three-part series)</h2>

<h2>How to Recruit in a Highly Competitive Job Market</h2>
<p class="author">By Jeff Moore

- Submitted by Michael Harvey

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re recruiting in a tight talent market, the goal isn&rsquo;t to have every candidate choose you over competitors. A candidate might be a poor match for your company but a great fit for a competitor.</p>
<p>Instead, handle the competition by highlighting your employer&rsquo;s brand, showing candidates what it&rsquo;s like to work at your company. Leave it to the candidate to decide what they want and determine if your company is the right fit. This will filter out the candidates who wouldn&rsquo;t be happy in the role, and will allow you to hire the person who genuinely wants to work at your company.</p>

<h2>Kite Launches AI-Powered JavaScript Completions — Code Faster with Kite</h2>

- Submitted by Twinkle Pardeshi

</p>

    <p>The JavaScript ecosystem continually invents new frameworks and design patterns. These inventions make it a vibrant place to be, but it also creates the need to learn an ever-changing set of code patterns and APIs. Kite&rsquo;s deep learning models have learned all of these patterns, understand the context of your code, so Kite can predict chunks of code and put them in your completions.</p>

<h2>The Last (Engineering) Dance</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>This blog post is about taking lessons from The Last Dance and applying them to the engineering world. I&rsquo;ll focus on the processes that took place in the Chicago Bulls that converted them from a great team to the best group of their time. A lot can be learned from the different approaches that the coaches took and the different behaviors of Michael Jordan that led to this improvement in the team&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<h2>What Mentors Wish Their Mentees Knew</h2>
<p class="author">By Vineet Chopra, MDSanjay Saint, MD

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The mentor-mentee relationship is a tango between a more senior person and a junior one. Just as in dance, coordination and orchestration between parties is necessary for grace and success. And while we and others have written about what makes the ideal mentor, comparatively less attention has been given to the other partner. This gap is unfortunate because, like mentorship, menteeship requires specific behaviors &mdash; without which the mentee&rsquo;s success may be threatened. In this article, we outline six habits of ideal mentees and provide anecdotes and views from our combined years of academic experience. While we focus on the relationship in academic medicine, the takeaways apply to most any field.&rdquo; </p>
