<h2>5 Ways to Optimize Tests for Continuous Integration</h2>
<p class="author">By John Ruberto

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many teams have existing automated test suites that are not included in a continuous integration program. Maybe the tests take too long to execute, or they are not reliable enough to give accurate results. Here&rsquo;s how to assess your test suites in terms of value added and time to execute, along with five proven strategies to optimize those suites for CI.</p>

<h2>AHAB’S ARITHMETIC; OR, THE MATHEMATICS OF MOBY-DICK</h2>
<p class="author">By Sarah Hart

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Herman Melville&rsquo;s novel Moby-Dick contains a surprising number of mathematical allusions. In this article we explore some of these, as well as discussing the questions that naturally follow: why did Melville choose to use so much mathematical imagery? How did Melville come to acquire the level of mathematical knowledge shown in the novel? And is it commensurate with the general level of mathematical literacy at that time?</p>

<h2>Bored People Quit</h2>

    <p>We talk a lot about associate success and retention and when I came across this article I found it to be a good read, not just for managers but individual contributors as well.  Because we (Red Hat) tell our employees that they own their careers I found the &quot;They tell you.

<h2>Building a First Team Mindset</h2>
<p class="author">By Jason Wong

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A First Team mindset is the idea that leaders prioritize supporting their fellow leaders over supporting their direct reports&mdash;that they are responsible to their peers more than they are to their individual teams. If you&rsquo;re not entirely onboard with that concept, I get it. It took me a while to come around to it myself.</p>

<h2>Extracting Super Mario Bros levels with Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Matthew Earl

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For an upcoming project, I need to extract level data from the classic 1985 video game Super Mario Bros (SMB). More precisely, I want to extract the background imagery for each stage of the game, excluding HUD elements and moving sprites, etc. Of course, I could just stitch together images from the game, and perhaps automate this process with computer vision techniques. But I think the method described below is more interesting, and allows for inspection of elements of the level perhaps not exposed through screenshots. </p>

<h2>Floating cities could ease the world’s housing crunch, the UN says</h2>
<p class="author">By Andrew Revkin

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>They envision an eventual galaxy of satellite &ldquo;cities&rdquo; built where coastal urbanization is hitting limits. They would consist of mass-produced, storm-worthy hexagonal floating modules, towed into position, moored and connected in larger arrays topped by sustainably built housing, workplaces, recreational and religious facilities, and the rest. Ferries and drones would be a tie line to shore. The communities would be sustained as much as possible with local solar and other renewable energy, recirculating water and rainwater, and local food production.</p>

<h2>Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming</h2>
<p class="author">By Charles Scalfani

- Submitted by Daniel Gur

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been programming in Object Oriented languages for decades. The first OO language I used was C++ and then Smalltalk and finally .NET and Java.</p>
<p><br>
I was gung-ho to leverage the benefits of Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. The Three Pillars of the Paradigm.</p>
<p><br>
I was eager to gain the promise of Reuse and leverage the wisdom gained by those who came before me in this new and exciting landscape.</p>
<p><br>
I couldn&rsquo;t contain my excitement at the thought of mapping my real-world objects into their Classes and expected the whole world to fall neatly into place.</p>
<p><br>
I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.</p>

<h2>Make. It. Simple. Linux Desktop Usability</h2>
<p class="author">By probono

- Submitted by Pete Savage

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Why do desktop environments increasingly degrade the desktop UX that once used to be straightforward and &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;? Is there a secret plan to cripple the desktop experience by infecting it with less suitable UX concepts invented for mobile phones? In this series, I will look at recent worrisome trends in desktop Linux usability and contrast them with the thoughts of the very inventors of the desktop metaphor as we know it. </p>

<h2>Remote Workers Are Outperforming Office Workers--Here&#39;s Why</h2>

    <p>Research shows that office workers cannot concentrate at their desks. In fact, one study found that the number of people who say they cannot concentrate at their desk has increased by 16 percent since 2008. Also startling: The number of workers who say they do not have access to quiet places to do focused work is up by 13 percent.</p>

<h2>The Invention of Zero: How Ancient Mesopotamia Created the Mathematical Concept of Nought and Ancient India Gave It Symbolic Form</h2>

    <p>Central to humanity&rsquo;s quest to grasp the nature of the universe and make sense of our own existence is zero, which began in Mesopotamia and spurred one of the most significant paradigm shifts in human consciousness &mdash; a concept first invented (or perhaps discovered) in pre-Arab Sumer, modern-day Iraq, and later given symbolic form in ancient India.</p>
