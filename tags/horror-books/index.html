<h2>12 Signs Youâ€™re Working in a Feature Factory</h2>
<p class="author">By John Cutler

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve used the term Feature Factory at a couple conference talks over the past two years. I started using the term when a software developer friend complained that he was &ldquo;just sitting in the factory, cranking out features, and sending them down the line.</p>
<p>How do you know if you&rsquo;re working in a feature factory?</p>

<h2>Behavior-Driven Development with Django and Aloe</h2>
<p class="author">By Jason Parent

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Imagine you are a Django developer building a social network for a lean startup. The CEO is pressuring your team for an MVP. The engineers have agreed to build the product using behavior-driven development (BDD) to deliver fast and efficient results. The product owner gives you the first feature request, and following the practice of all good programming methodologies, you begin the BDD process by writing a test. Next you code a bit of functionality to make your test pass and you consider your design. The last step requires you to analyze the feature itself. Does it belong in your app?</p>

<h2>Colossal Cave Adventure: Building and running 40-year-old code from the dawn of gaming</h2>
<p class="author">By Doug Tidewell

<p>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.<br>
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building<br>
and down a gully.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? If you&rsquo;re an old-school gamer, you&rsquo;ve probably seen these words hundreds of times. They&rsquo;re the starting point for Colossal Cave Adventure, the first major computer game. It was created in 1977 by Willie Crowther and Don Woods and quickly became a phenomenon in those pre-GUI, pre-Internet years. What helped the game spread from one data center to another was the fact that the source code was freely available.</p>
<p>The last version of the code from the original authors was written in 1995, and if you&rsquo;re like us, you're hearing this story and wondering where that code is now. With the encouragement and permission of the authors, open source pioneer Eric S. Raymond has ported the code to his GitLab account. In this article, we&rsquo;ll show you how to build and run that code.</p>

<h2>Dockerizing modern web apps</h2>
<p class="author">By Hendrik

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most websites these days are Single Page Applications (SPA for short) where a single entry file handles all routes that a user might visit. Swept up in the ongoing trend of hosting in the cloud you might find yourself needing to &ldquo;dockerize&rdquo; your SPA. That is to say wrap it inside a Docker image and run it as a container. In this post we will explore how we can get that done.</p>

<h2>How to improve your 1:1 with your manager</h2>
<p class="author">By Tomas Sykora

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Imagine you are looking at your calendar and there is 1:1 session scheduled for 2 PM today. Maybe it is with your manager, or maybe you&rsquo;re a manager about to talk with someone who reports to you. So how do you feel? Happy? Anxious? Neutral? Thinking about losing your time, again? Spending your time well and proactively? Able to push things forward? Competing against&hellip;you don&rsquo;t even know what exactly? Complaining once more? Feeling excitement about sharing your recent achievements? Feeling awkward as you don&rsquo;t know what to say? Expecting to get and provide candid feedback?</p>
<p>You can certainly experience a whole mixture of emotions before, during, and after 1:1 meetings. And even if you think you do &ldquo;quite fine&rdquo; in this area and know how to have effective 1:1s, we think it could be at least a bit better at Red Hat!</p>

<h2>The Career Management Secret I Wish I Had Known in My Twenties</h2>
<p class="author">By David Cancel

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I used to have these meetings with Dave Gerhardt (DG). Back then, DG was the only marketer and he had just joined the team, so I was explaining to him how he could set himself up to grow as the company was growing. And I said that what happens is, usually, if a company is growing quickly, if they&rsquo;re experiencing hypergrowth, that company will end up growing faster than the individual.</p>

<h2>Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.</h2>
