<h2>Deactivating the “Somebody Else’s Problem” Field</h2>
<p class="author">By Areti Panou

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>If keeping the pipeline running is so important, why do we sometimes ignore failures? Why do we put up with failing tests? What makes us turn a blind eye to broken steps? What stops us from taking action to fix the issues? (&hellip;) The failing steps are somebody else’s problem because we don&rsquo;t want to see them, we don&rsquo;t expect to see them, or we can&rsquo;t explain them. In this article, you will find examples of such unpleasant steps along with some ideas and suggestions on how to improve them.</p>

<h2>Desk check</h2>
<p class="author">By Lina Zubyte

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We should think of quality everywhere in the process. If we choose to do so, a practice that can prove to be valuable is a desk check. <strong>Desk checks help to create shared accountability on quality.</strong></p>

<h2>Did you break your code today?</h2>
<p class="author">By Kevin Hicks

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I broke my code today. And I&rsquo;m glad I did. (&hellip;) I&rsquo;m happy that I broke my code before anyone else broke it. I found the issue before it caused problems for users and before I spent QA&rsquo;s and a peer reviewer&rsquo;s time. We should all be aiming to do this.</p>

<h2>How does Quality fit in CALMS?</h2>
<p class="author">By Areti Panou

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I needed to figure out what a Quality Strategy is and what makes it unique in a DevOps world. Instead of trying to come up with a definition, I started considering what are some quality specific aspects within the CALMS framework that would help a DevOps transformation. So, here are a few ideas on the Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement and Sharing aspects to consider that might improve the overall quality of a system, from idea to end user.</p>

<h2>PatternFly and the Open UI Automation specification</h2>
<p class="author">By Pete Savage

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>UI testing is hard. I believe this challenge has led to a considerable shift in recent years to do less UI testing, focusing instead on REST testing and unit testing UI pages. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. But with less focus on the piece of the application users interact with the most, there is a risk that something will be missed &mdash; and bugs creep in.</p>

<h2>The epistemology of software quality</h2>

<h2>The golden rule of software quality</h2>
<p class="author">By Gabriel Gonzalez

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The golden rule is:</p>
<p>Prefer to push fixes upstream instead of working around problems downstream</p>
<p>… and I’ll explain implications of this rule for a few software engineering tradeoffs (using examples from the Haskell community and ecosystem).</p>

<h2>The Mind at Work: Ted Chiang on making stories that change our minds</h2>
<p class="author">By Anthony Wing Kosner

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Why do we tell stories? And why in a world with such an overabundance of information is there even room for fiction? Access to information has made our jobs increasingly data-driven and would appear to put a premium on being factual. But unlike industrial labor, knowledge work, for all of its data, is much harder to measure, and stories are a proven method for trying on alternate realities that we may or may not want to manifest. We tell stories so that other people can imagine an experience we want to share. Without fiction, there are no new ideas. Even a scientific theory is fictional until proven.</p>
