<h2>Empowerment can be tricky!</h2>
<p class="author">By Jeremy West

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Within the past several weeks I've had the opportunity to mentor and be mentored on the topic of empowering your team while maintaining respect for RACI rules. When I look back at in my career at the times I felt most inspired by my leaders, those memorable scenarios were almost always driven through an empowerment model. The recipe for those scenarios was always the same. My team and manager was being presented with a particular challenge and I would be asked to identify the solution and then execute on that solution. Minimal manager oversight and trust played key roles. I imagine my managers all experienced some level of anxiety in allowing me to own the solution, so how did they manage the risk?&rdquo; </p>

<h2>My 7 rules for remote-work sanity</h2>
<p class="author">By Mike Bursell

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;I work remotely, and have done, on and off, for a good percentage of the past 10-15 years. I&rsquo;m lucky that I&rsquo;m in a role where this suits my responsibilities, and in a company &ndash; Red Hat &ndash; that is set up for it. Not all roles &ndash; those with many customer onsite meetings, or those with a major service component &ndash; are suited to remote working, of course, but it&rsquo;s clear that an increasing number of organisations are considering having at least some of their workers doing so remotely.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Who Is Marcus Aurelius? Getting To Know The Roman Emperor</h2>
<p class="author">By Daily Stoic

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Agasicles, king of the Spartans, once quipped that he wanted to be &lsquo;the student of men whose son I should like to be as well.&rsquo; It is a critical consideration we need to make in our search for role models. Stoicism is no exception. Before we begin our studies we need to ask ourselves: Who are the people that followed these precepts? Who can I point out as an example? Am I proud to look up to this person? Do I want to be more like them?</p>
<p>And Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, born nearly two millennia ago (121 &ndash; 180), is a leader and example who provides a resounding yes.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Why your mock doesn’t work</h2>
<p class="author">By Ned Batchelder

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Mocking is a powerful technique for isolating tests from undesired interactions among components. But often people find their mock isn&rsquo;t taking effect, and it&rsquo;s not clear why. Hopefully this explanation will clear things up.&rdquo; </p>
