    <p>&ldquo;The NumPy package is the workhorse of data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing in the python ecosystem.

<h2>Collection Pipeline</h2>
<p class="author">By Martin Fowler

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Collection pipelines are a programming pattern where you organize some computation as a sequence of operations which compose by taking a collection as output of one operation and feeding it into the next. (Common operations are filter, map, and reduce.) This pattern is common in functional programming, and also in object-oriented languages which have lambdas. This article describes the pattern with several examples of how to form pipelines, both to introduce the pattern to those unfamiliar with it, and to help people understand the core concepts so they can more easily take ideas from one language to another.</p>

<h2>Colossal Cave Adventure: Building and running 40-year-old code from the dawn of gaming</h2>
<p class="author">By Doug Tidewell

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
<p>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.<br>
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building<br>
and down a gully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar? If you&rsquo;re an old-school gamer, you&rsquo;ve probably seen these words hundreds of times. They&rsquo;re the starting point for Colossal Cave Adventure, the first major computer game. It was created in 1977 by Willie Crowther and Don Woods and quickly became a phenomenon in those pre-GUI, pre-Internet years. What helped the game spread from one data center to another was the fact that the source code was freely available.</p>
<p>The last version of the code from the original authors was written in 1995, and if you&rsquo;re like us, you're hearing this story and wondering where that code is now. With the encouragement and permission of the authors, open source pioneer Eric S. Raymond has ported the code to his GitLab account. In this article, we&rsquo;ll show you how to build and run that code.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most websites these days are Single Page Applications (SPA for short) where a single entry file handles all routes that a user might visit. Swept up in the ongoing trend of hosting in the cloud you might find yourself needing to &ldquo;dockerize&rdquo; your SPA. That is to say wrap it inside a Docker image and run it as a container. In this post we will explore how we can get that done.</p>

<h2>Generating castles for Minecraft™ using Haskell</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;My kids and I have enjoyed building various structures in the game Minecraft, but it can get rather monotonous placing blocks one-at-a-time. I took a very brief look at the custom &ldquo;mods&rdquo; available, but wanted something more compositional, hence the idea for a Haskell DSL was born. The aim is to build a skeleton structure, thereby eliminating the most repetitive parts of manual construction, for example walls, floors, roofs etc. We can then enjoy furnishing the structures by hand in the actual game.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Life lessons for the aspiring software engineer</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to the craft of software engineering than just the ability to code. In fact, I would say that the ability to write programs accounts for less than half of the skills that a good engineer needs to have.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Innovation has always been part of the Amazon DNA, but about 20 years ago, we went through a radical transformation with the goal of making our iterative process&mdash;&quot;invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat, again and again&quot;&mdash;even faster. The changes we made affected both how we built applications and how we organized our company.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Podman and Buildah for Docker users</h2>
<p class="author">By William Henry

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I was asked recently on Twitter to better explain Podman and Buildah for someone familiar with Docker. Though there are many blogs and tutorials out there, which I will list later, we in the community have not centralized an explanation of how Docker users move from Docker to Podman and Buildah. Also what role does Buildah play? Is Podman deficient in some way that we need both Podman and Buildah to replace Docker?</p>
<p>This article answers those questions and shows how to migrate to Podman.</p>

<h2>Podman: Managing pods and containers in a local container runtime</h2>
<p class="author">By Brent Baude

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>People associate running pods with Kubernetes. And when they run containers in their development runtimes, they do not even think about the role pods could play&mdash;even in a localized runtime. Most people coming from the Docker world of running single containers do not envision the concept of running pods. There are several good reasons to consider using pods locally, other than using pods to naturally group your containers.</p>

    <p>I used to have these meetings with Dave Gerhardt (DG).
