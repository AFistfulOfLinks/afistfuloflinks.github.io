<h2>14 Mistakes I Did That You Should Avoid As A Newbie Automation Tester</h2>
<p class="author">By Harshit Paul

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When you start your journey as an automation tester, then mistakes are bound to happen. (...) And while it is good to learn from your mistakes, it is always better to be preventive by learning from others.</p>

<h2>A Pythonic Guide to SOLID Design Principles</h2>
<p class="author">By Derek D.

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>People that know me will tell you I am a big fan of the SOLID Design Principles championed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). Over the years I've used these principles in C#, PHP, Node.js, and Python. Everywhere I took them they were generally well-received...except when I started working in Python. (...) Since then I've been on a mission to prove SOLID code is Pythonic.</p>

<h2>Beware of chicken testing! (or mocks overuse)</h2>
<p class="author">By Sebastian Buczyński

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The most basic problem with Mock-based tests is that they can give you passing tests even though the code won&rsquo;t work in QA/Staging/Production environment. It is simply because they are not the same implementation.</p>

<h2>Data-Oriented Architecture</h2>
<p class="author">By Paul Downey

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Data-Oriented Architecture is an inversion of the traditional dichotomy between a monolithic binary and data store (monolithic architecture) on the one hand, and small, distributed, independent binaries each with their own data stores (microservices, and service-oriented architecture) on the other. In data-oriented architecture, a monolithic data store is the sole source of state in the system, which is being acted on by loosely-coupled, stateless microservices.</p>

<h2>Designing with types (eight-part series)</h2>
<p class="author">By Scott Wlaschin

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In this series, we’ll look at some of the ways we can use types as part of the design process. In particular, the thoughtful use of types can make a design more transparent and improve correctness at the same time. (&hellip;) Many of the suggestions are also feasible in C# or Java, but the lightweight nature of F# types means that it is much more likely that we will do this kind of refactoring.</p>

<h2>Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar</h2>
<p class="author">By Alexandra Noonan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In early 2017 we reached a tipping point with a core piece of Segment&rsquo;s product. It seemed as if we were falling from the microservices tree, hitting every branch on the way down. Instead of enabling us to move faster, the small team found themselves mired in exploding complexity. (...) Something had to change. This post is the story of how we took a step back and embraced an approach that aligned well with our product requirements and needs of the team.</p>

<h2>Multiple inheritance and mixin classes in Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Leonardo Giordani

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I (...) noticed once again that the code base uses mixin classes to increase code reuse. I also realised that mixins are not very popular in Python, so I decided to explore them, brushing up my knowledge of the OOP theory in the meanwhile.</p>
