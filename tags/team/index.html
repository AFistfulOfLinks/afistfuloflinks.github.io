<h2>Deploying a Flask app using AWS</h2>
<p class="author">By Imran Khan

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In this blog we will create a basic Flask application and deploy this to the web using AWS Lambda. The application is a simple API that takes as input some user defined data and posts the output. The inputs will also be saved to a database using AWS RDS.</p>
<p>Our simple API will calculate the roots of a given quadratic equation. It will take as input three numerical values which represent the coefficients and calculate the values (if they exist). We will also add in a way to store a record of these values in a database.</p>

<h2>Efficient Software Project Management at its Roots</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;After a decade of shipping software projects in various environments, I have started to notice patterns on projects that are more successful than others. The most surprising thing I'm seeing is how actual, day to day project management methodology is not the most important predictor of project success. Instead, the things I observed making or break software projects are pretty universal and little to do with methodologies like Scrum, Kanban or Waterfall-style approaches.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Everything is Amazing, But Nothing is Ours</h2>
<p class="author">By Alex Danco

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot; Worlds of scarcity are made out of things. Worlds of abundance are made out of dependencies. That&rsquo;s the software playbook: find a system made of costly, redundant objects; and rearrange it into a fast, frictionless system made of logical dependencies. The delta in performance is irresistible, and dependencies are a compelling building block: they seem like just a piece of logic, with no cost and no friction. But they absolutely have a cost: the cost is complexity, outsourced agency, and brittleness. The cost of ownership is up front and visible; the cost of access is back-dated and hidden.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>How to Create Animated Graphs in Python</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Matplotlib and Seaborn are some nice libraries in Python to create great looking plots. But these plots are all static and it&rsquo;s hard to depict the change of data values in a dynamic and pleasingly looking way. How nice would it be if in you next presentation, video or social media post you can present development in the data by using a short video clip? And even better, you can still keep using Matplotlib, Seaborn or any other library that you like to use for your plots!</p>

<h2>Independence, autonomy, and too many small teams</h2>
<p class="author">By Kislay Verma

<blockquote>
    <p>I argue that we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams” (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>

<h2>SLOs Are the API for Your Engineering Team</h2>
<p class="author">By Charity Majors

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>If your job involves direct leadership of engineering teams, managing how and what they deliver, you&rsquo;ve surely come across situations where the pressure to deliver features won out and led to poor service reliability. You&rsquo;ve probably had your team&rsquo;s workflow disrupted by interference from senior managers about minor individual issues. Or, you&rsquo;ve seen or heard execs questioning your team&rsquo;s planned work to reduce technical debt or improve your delivery processes.</p>
<p>These kinds of clashes are extremely common between engineering teams and management, as well as among different engineering teams. They are all various manifestations of a single issue: the need for a better abstraction layer for people and teams who are trying to interact or collaborate with your team. That abstraction layer is called Service Level Objectives.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In college, a professor&rsquo;s goal is for everyone to learn. At a company, though, the goal is for the business to succeed. Learning, and teaching, are techniques used to reach that goal. It&rsquo;s typically expected that the senior engineers teach as well as learn. So instead of letting those junior engineers figure it out on their own, give them a mentor. With a mentor, their straightforward projects will teach them more and they&rsquo;ll deliver faster, too.&rdquo; </p>
