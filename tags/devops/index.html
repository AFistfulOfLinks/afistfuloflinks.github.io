<h2>How to design a RESTful API architecture from a human-language spec</h2>
<p class="author">By Filipe XimenesFlávio Juvenal

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Like almost all software, an API needs to reflect the needs of the humans who interact with it. An API is somewhat different from a GUI or other user interface because it interacts with a programmer rather than directly with the end user. However, the principles of designing for the user still apply: you must think of the background knowledge brought by the programmers and the constraints under which they are operating, such as the bandwidth of mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Managing Performance When It’s Hard to Measure</h2>
<p class="author">By Jim Whitehurst

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Organizations of all kinds have long struggled to accurately measure the performance of individual members. The typical approach is to assess an individual&rsquo;s performance against a metric usually tied to whether or not they performed a task and the amount of output they generated by doing so. There&rsquo;s a lot riding on these assessments: everything from compensation increases and bonus payments to promotions. And as anyone who has ever given or received a traditional performance review knows, this process can be highly subjective &mdash; even in the most metrics-obsessed organizations.</p>
<p>But what about the kinds of jobs where measuring someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;output&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about counting the number of widgets they produced, but rather it&rsquo;s about how they managed a team or influenced others or helped people collaborate better? While it might be easy to measure someone&rsquo;s output on an assembly line, how do we decide how well a manager manages or a leader leads?</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Monolithic, consolidated applications are not bad. These are your Rails apps, your Django apps, etc. &mdash; the ones where your server sends back HTML and assets.

<h2>Testing Microservices, the sane way</h2>
<p class="author">By Cindy Sridharan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The ability to develop, deploy and scale different business functionality independently is one of the most touted benefits of adopting a microservices architecture. While the jury&rsquo;s still out on if these benefits really check out or not, microservices are very much in vogue, to the point where this architecture has now become the default of even many startups. Yet when it comes to testing (or worse, when developing) microservices, most organizations seem to be quite attached to an antediluvian model of testing all components in unison.</p>

<h2>Weak Supervision: A New Programming Paradigm for Machine Learning</h2>
<p class="author">By Alex Ratner, Paroma Varma, Braden Hancock, Chris Ré, and other members of Hazy Lab

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In recent years, the real-world impact of machine learning (ML) has grown in leaps and bounds. In large part, this is due to the advent of deep learning models, which allow practitioners to get state-of-the-art scores on benchmark datasets without any hand-engineered features. Given the availability of multiple open-source ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and an abundance of available state-of-the-art models, it can be argued that high-quality ML models are almost a commoditized resource now. There is a hidden catch, however: the reliance of these models on massive sets of hand-labeled training data.</p>

<h2>Why feedback, not metrics, is critical to DevOps</h2>
<p class="author">By Ranjith Varakantam

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most managers and agile coaches depend on metrics over feedback from their teams, users, and even customers. In fact, quite a few use feedback and metrics synonymously, where they present feedback from teams or customers as a bunch of numbers or a graphical representation of those numbers. This is not only unfortunate, but it can be misleading as it presents only part of the story and not the entire truth.</p>
<p>When it comes to two critical factors&mdash;how we manage or guide our teams and how we operate and influence the product that our teams are developing&mdash;few exceptional leaders and teams get it right.&quot; (</p>

<h2>Why Visionary Leadership Fails</h2>
<p class="author">By Nufer Yasin Ates, Murat Tarakci, Jeanine P. Porck, Daan van Knippenberg, and Patrick Groenen

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Visionary leadership is widely seen as key to strategic change. That&rsquo;s because visionary leadership does not just set the strategic direction &mdash; it tells a story about why the change is worth pursuing and inspires people to embrace the change. Not surprisingly, then, science and practice have a very positive view of visionary leadership as a critical leadership competency.</p>
<p>But our research finds that the positive impact of visionary leadership breaks down when middle managers aren&rsquo;t aligned with top management&rsquo;s strategic vision. This can cause strategic change efforts to slow down or even fail.</p>
