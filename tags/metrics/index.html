<h2>&#34;Blameless&#34; postmortems don&#39;t work. Here&#39;s what does.</h2>

<h2>7 absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer</h2>
<p class="author">By Monica Lent

- Submitted by Yanis Guenane

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In reflecting on this first decade of getting regularly paid money to type weird symbols into my Terminal, I wanted to take some time to share some of the ways my thinking shifted over the years as a developer.</p>
<p><strong>For today&rsquo;s junior developers:</strong> Maybe you&rsquo;ll find something here you currently believe, and get inspired to learn more about it and why the topic is so multi-faceted. Or maybe you&rsquo;ll find this post encouraging because you&rsquo;re already so far ahead of where I was at your stage.</p>
<p><strong>For today&rsquo;s senior developers:</strong> Maybe you can relate, and also have some funny (and humbling) stories to share about your own life lessons when you were a junior dev.</p>

<h2>Finding the metrics that matter for your product</h2>

    <p>These concepts might help your business in the short term, but can leave you blinded by the very data you hoped would open your eyes in the long term. So how do you go from simply plugging your numbers into cookie-cutter formulas to answering key questions about your product and business? And are you even asking the right questions in the first place?</p>

<h2>How to Get Regression Defects Under Control</h2>
<p class="author">By Kathryn Nest

- Submitted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cswiii" class="submitter">Corey Welton</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Regression defects can be the most frustrating thing in the software world.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what that means, exactly, or you don&rsquo;t have direct experience with it, let me set the stage for you. Your team has been working on a software release for months. It&rsquo;s been something of a grind, and you&rsquo;ve had to cut a few corners to go live by your deadline, but you&rsquo;re going to ship on time. Sure, you anticipate some glitches, but at least you didn&rsquo;t fail to deliver.</p>
<p>You ship the software and, sure enough, reports of glitches do come in. And, as you anticipated, these have to do with the new functionality you developed. Er, some of them do, anyway.</p>
<p>But there are a bunch of other problems besides. And these don&rsquo;t seem to have anything to do with what you shipped. Users are reporting bugs in things that have always worked since the day you&rsquo;ve developed them. And they&rsquo;re understandably not happy about this.</p>
<p>These are regression defects.</p>

<h2>Managing Performance When It’s Hard to Measure</h2>
<p class="author">By Jim Whitehurst

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Organizations of all kinds have long struggled to accurately measure the performance of individual members. The typical approach is to assess an individual&rsquo;s performance against a metric usually tied to whether or not they performed a task and the amount of output they generated by doing so. There&rsquo;s a lot riding on these assessments: everything from compensation increases and bonus payments to promotions. And as anyone who has ever given or received a traditional performance review knows, this process can be highly subjective &mdash; even in the most metrics-obsessed organizations.</p>
<p>But what about the kinds of jobs where measuring someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;output&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about counting the number of widgets they produced, but rather it&rsquo;s about how they managed a team or influenced others or helped people collaborate better? While it might be easy to measure someone&rsquo;s output on an assembly line, how do we decide how well a manager manages or a leader leads?</p>

<h2>Weak Supervision: A New Programming Paradigm for Machine Learning</h2>
<p class="author">By Alex Ratner, Paroma Varma, Braden Hancock, Chris Ré, and other members of Hazy Lab

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In recent years, the real-world impact of machine learning (ML) has grown in leaps and bounds. In large part, this is due to the advent of deep learning models, which allow practitioners to get state-of-the-art scores on benchmark datasets without any hand-engineered features. Given the availability of multiple open-source ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and an abundance of available state-of-the-art models, it can be argued that high-quality ML models are almost a commoditized resource now. There is a hidden catch, however: the reliance of these models on massive sets of hand-labeled training data.</p>

<h2>Why feedback, not metrics, is critical to DevOps</h2>
<p class="author">By Ranjith Varakantam

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most managers and agile coaches depend on metrics over feedback from their teams, users, and even customers. In fact, quite a few use feedback and metrics synonymously, where they present feedback from teams or customers as a bunch of numbers or a graphical representation of those numbers. This is not only unfortunate, but it can be misleading as it presents only part of the story and not the entire truth.</p>
<p>When it comes to two critical factors&mdash;how we manage or guide our teams and how we operate and influence the product that our teams are developing&mdash;few exceptional leaders and teams get it right.&quot; (</p>

<h2>Why Visionary Leadership Fails</h2>
<p class="author">By Nufer Yasin Ates, Murat Tarakci, Jeanine P. Porck, Daan van Knippenberg, and Patrick Groenen

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Visionary leadership is widely seen as key to strategic change. That&rsquo;s because visionary leadership does not just set the strategic direction &mdash; it tells a story about why the change is worth pursuing and inspires people to embrace the change. Not surprisingly, then, science and practice have a very positive view of visionary leadership as a critical leadership competency.</p>
<p>But our research finds that the positive impact of visionary leadership breaks down when middle managers aren&rsquo;t aligned with top management&rsquo;s strategic vision. This can cause strategic change efforts to slow down or even fail.</p>
