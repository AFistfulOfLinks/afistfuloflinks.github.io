<h2>Bit by Bit</h2>
<p class="author">By Nimisha Mukherjee

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>This year we decided to conduct a hackathon at the Bangalore Engineering office. We started with the idea of doing something around diversity and inclusion. We adopted the International Women's Day theme - #BalanceforBetter, as it resonated with Red Hat's Diversity &amp; Inclusion program. The only rule we applied was that we wanted the participating teams to have at least one woman on their team.</p>

<h2>Don&#39;t Work Alone When You&#39;re a New or Junior Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By Gergely Orosz

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;One of the recurring things that come to bite me and my team is having a less experienced engineer or new joiner work completely alone on a project for weeks or months. We&rsquo;ve done this multiple times, and the results were always similarly dire. The engineer ends up building something slightly - or very - different than what we intended to. They took a lot longer to do it - and their morale was down, due to feeling lonely and unproductive this time. They did make mistakes, but did not have anyone give them feedback, to learn from it. Every time we sat down and did a retrospective on what to do different, next time, we agreed on the same thing: have someone to work with from the start.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Fix by symptoms, fix by causes</h2>
<p class="author">By Maaret Pyhäjärvi

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>As testers, we are taught to describe what we observe, the symptoms. Yet the way we are able to frame those symptoms triggers memories and ideas of what the right, proper solution is with the developers. And my new colleague is very right that them doing their job on reporting is not sufficient. They can, and should, work on setting the relationship right so that instead of fixing by symptoms, we fix by causes.</p>

<h2>How To Be A Mentor</h2>
<p class="author">By James Hickey

<blockquote>
    <p>In one of my previous <a href="https://dev.to/jamesmh/becoming-an-intermediate-developer-mh9">posts</a>, we looked at the career stage of being an intermediate developer.</p>
<p>One of the pieces of advice I gave was to find a mentor.</p>
<p>Today, I want to look at the flip-side of that topic: how to be a mentor!</p>

<h2>How to communicate effectively as a leader</h2>
<p class="author">By Joseph Gefroh

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many first-time leaders see their teams devolve into chaos and their effectiveness reduced by unnecessary friction.</p>
<p><br>
Because of their lack of experience, they resort to large, sweeping changes in their attempts to improve the effectiveness of their organizations and fulfill their vision.\</p>
<p>These herculean efforts fail over and over, while the real solution sits ignored in front of them: communicate better.</p>

<h2>How to offer challenges to your teammates</h2>
<p class="author">By Lara Hogan

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Think about when a manager&rsquo;s helped skyrocket your growth&mdash;what did they do? Did they teach you a new skill? Did they give you hard feedback?</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, when I ask this question to groups of workshop attendees, people describe a time when a manager sponsored them for a visible (and often scary) stretch assignment. An assignment that these workshop participants didn&rsquo;t exactly know how to do, and it felt fairly high stakes&mdash;but their manager trusted they could do it, for some reason. This trust, and this stretchy project, helped them grow exponentially.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Multiply your time by asking 4 questions about the stuff on your to-do list</h2>

    <p>OK, this post won&rsquo;t tell you how to magically make each day 38 hours long (we&rsquo;re still working on that). But by assessing our tasks in terms of their significance, we can free up more time tomorrow, says leadership coach Rory Vaden.</p>

<h2>The Danger of “Simplicity”</h2>
<p class="author">By asthasr

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Who hasn&rsquo;t shaved a yak? Still, the ultimate purpose of programming as a profession or hobby is clear: we want to apply the raw power of computation to a problem, and know that the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve written can be trusted to solve the problem we think that it does. Code, in itself, is not an asset. A solved problem is an asset.&rdquo; </p>
