<h2>Application-Driven API Design</h2>
<p class="author">By Stephen Mizell

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When designing APIs, it&rsquo;s important to take a design-first approach to ensure the right API gets built. However, I don&rsquo;t think the first step should be to write an OpenAPI or API Blueprint document. I think it should be to design a working application.</p>

<h2>Becoming a team lead: a survival guide</h2>
<p class="author">By Joseph Wynn

- Submitted by <a href="https://elyezer.com/" class="submitter">Elyezer Rezende</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The reason this is a survival guide is because after spending my entire career as a software engineer, I was thrown into a team lead role without much warning. I had no idea what I was doing and had very little support. This is the survival guide I wish I had. It documents my experiences as an inexperienced team lead &ndash;as an engineer transitioning to a team lead&ndash; and my learnings &amp; mistakes along the way. Hopefully this can act as a survival guide for you, too. </p>

<h2>Effective Feedback - Is it Possible?</h2>
<p class="author">By Frank Jansen

- Submitted by <a href="https://alexis.monville.com/en/" class="submitter">Alexis Monville</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A recent Harvard Business Review (HBR) article appears to indicate that candid feedback should be avoided; in The Feedback Fallacy, the authors stipulate that this kind of feedback may be damaging. The authors' reference to the current excitement over apps based on 'Radical Candor' and the tendency toward direct, sometimes harsh feedback that is being promoted at a number of companies, seems to lead us away from that approach. But does it?</p>

<h2>Generating Random Data in Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Brad Solomon

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>How random is random? This is a weird question to ask, but it is one of paramount importance in cases where information security is concerned. Whenever you&rsquo;re generating random data, strings, or numbers in Python, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have at least a rough idea of how that data was generated.</p>

<h2>How we set goals for Goals</h2>
<p class="author">By Julie Caprio

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>So, rather than be afraid of not reaching a goal and therefore not setting one, I&rsquo;ve learned to just set it! And measure against it. And act on it. But that is the spirit of agile, after all, right?</p>

<h2>Participating in Code Reviews as a Tester</h2>
<p class="author">By Chris Kenst

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Code reviews are a popular method of catching bugs early in development through peer-reviewing someone&rsquo;s code. But perhaps more important than catching bugs, these reviews also serve as a chance to see how something is built and have a conversation about it. Because testers question software differently from developers, it&rsquo;s important that we participate in this knowledge-sharing practice.</p>

<h2>REST vs. GraphQL: A Critical Review</h2>
<p class="author">By Z

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Are you building an API? Here is the idea: If you have never heard about the REST architectural style constraints and their implication on the properties of the resulting distributed system and you do not want to (or can&rsquo;t) educate yourself, use GraphQL. </p>

<h2>Serverless Golang apps in 60 seconds</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this brief post I&rsquo;ll illustrate how quick it is production-ready serverless environment for any Golang application or API using Apex Up. This post assumes you have AWS credentials configured on your machine, as Up deploys to AWS Lambda and API Gateway.</p>

<h2>The Forgotten Woman Who Discovered the Greenhouse Effect</h2>
<p class="author">By Ian Steadman

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When did we realize that more carbon dioxide equals a hotter planet? You could go all the way back to 1827, when French mathematician Joseph Fourier calculated that the atmosphere, somehow, was keeping the planet warm like a blanket. Or you could go as late as 1938, when British engineer Guy Stewart Callendar gathered data for the first time to show that the Earth was already getting warmer in line with emissions.</p>
<p><br>
But over the last decade, a new answer has come to light: 1856. That&rsquo;s when amateur American scientist Eunice Foote discovered what we now call the greenhouse effect. Yet we know very little about her. We don&rsquo;t even know what she looked like.</p>
