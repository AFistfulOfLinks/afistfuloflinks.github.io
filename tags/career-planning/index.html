<h2>Benefits of Pranayama Based on Scientific Research</h2>
<p class="author">By Dr. Rishita Chandra

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Pranayama is about breathing science and having control over breathing brings many physical &amp; mental benefits. Controlled breathing by pranayama techniques lets you hold the horses of your mind, you keep calm, become able to think wisely, and make the correct decisions. It eventually makes you stress-free and happy. </p>

<h2>Don&#39;t Work Alone When You&#39;re a New or Junior Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By Gergely Orosz

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;One of the recurring things that come to bite me and my team is having a less experienced engineer or new joiner work completely alone on a project for weeks or months. We&rsquo;ve done this multiple times, and the results were always similarly dire. The engineer ends up building something slightly - or very - different than what we intended to. They took a lot longer to do it - and their morale was down, due to feeling lonely and unproductive this time. They did make mistakes, but did not have anyone give them feedback, to learn from it. Every time we sat down and did a retrospective on what to do different, next time, we agreed on the same thing: have someone to work with from the start.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>How To Break The “Senior Engineer” Career Ceiling</h2>
<p class="author">By Yan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Writing more code or releasing more features alone doesn&rsquo;t make you a better senior engineer. It&rsquo;s about your ability to deliver a meaningful business impact through your execution. This is the change in mindset that will set you on your way to the next level. </p>

<h2>How to offer challenges to your teammates</h2>
<p class="author">By Lara Hogan

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Think about when a manager&rsquo;s helped skyrocket your growth&mdash;what did they do? Did they teach you a new skill? Did they give you hard feedback?</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, when I ask this question to groups of workshop attendees, people describe a time when a manager sponsored them for a visible (and often scary) stretch assignment. An assignment that these workshop participants didn&rsquo;t exactly know how to do, and it felt fairly high stakes&mdash;but their manager trusted they could do it, for some reason. This trust, and this stretchy project, helped them grow exponentially.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Lessons learned managing the GitLab Data team</h2>
<p class="author">By Taylor A. Murphy

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>From April 2018 to May 2019 I was the manager of the Data team for GitLab. I took this role after my manager left, when I started reporting directly to the CFO as a Data Engineer. I remember saying to him &quot;this doesn't seem like the right level of abstraction for you,&quot; and proposed I step up to become the manager. I also said I didn't want to do this for a long period of time, since I intentionally came to GitLab to move from a manager role to an individual contributor role and focus on Data Engineering. What follows are a few lessons I learned (and relearned!) in my one-year stint as the manager of the Data team. Eventually, I aim to become a manager again and I hope to remember these lessons and learn even more. </p>

<h2>The Certainty of Failure</h2>
<p class="author">By marcgg

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Everyone makes mistakes, that should be a given. Knowing this, the question becomes not &ldquo;if&rdquo; one will slip, but &ldquo;when&rdquo;. Of course, experience and working hard can help in reducing the number of errors, but there&rsquo;s no way for someone to have an absolutely perfect track record.</p>

<h2>The Danger of “Simplicity”</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Who hasn&rsquo;t shaved a yak? Still, the ultimate purpose of programming as a profession or hobby is clear: we want to apply the raw power of computation to a problem, and know that the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve written can be trusted to solve the problem we think that it does. Code, in itself, is not an asset. A solved problem is an asset.&rdquo; </p>
