<h2>12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature Factory</h2>
<p class="author">By John Cutler

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve used the term Feature Factory at a couple conference talks over the past two years. I started using the term when a software developer friend complained that he was &ldquo;just sitting in the factory, cranking out features, and sending them down the line.</p>
<p>How do you know if you&rsquo;re working in a feature factory?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many teams have existing automated test suites that are not included in a continuous integration program. Maybe the tests take too long to execute, or they are not reliable enough to give accurate results. Here&rsquo;s how to assess your test suites in terms of value added and time to execute, along with five proven strategies to optimize those suites for CI.</p>

<h2>Behavior-Driven Development with Django and Aloe</h2>
<p class="author">By Jason Parent

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Imagine you are a Django developer building a social network for a lean startup. The CEO is pressuring your team for an MVP. The engineers have agreed to build the product using behavior-driven development (BDD) to deliver fast and efficient results. The product owner gives you the first feature request, and following the practice of all good programming methodologies, you begin the BDD process by writing a test. Next you code a bit of functionality to make your test pass and you consider your design. The last step requires you to analyze the feature itself. Does it belong in your app?</p>

<h2>Fulfilling the promise of CI/CD</h2>
<p class="author">By Charity Majors

<blockquote>
    <p>When people say “CI/CD,” they are only talking about continuous integration. Nobody is talking about (or practicing) continuous deployment. AT ALL. It’s like we have all forgotten it exists. It&rsquo;s time to change that.</p>

<h2>How to improve your 1:1 with your manager</h2>
<p class="author">By Tomas Sykora

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Imagine you are looking at your calendar and there is 1:1 session scheduled for 2 PM today. Maybe it is with your manager, or maybe you&rsquo;re a manager about to talk with someone who reports to you. So how do you feel? Happy? Anxious? Neutral? Thinking about losing your time, again? Spending your time well and proactively? Able to push things forward? Competing against&hellip;you don&rsquo;t even know what exactly? Complaining once more? Feeling excitement about sharing your recent achievements? Feeling awkward as you don&rsquo;t know what to say? Expecting to get and provide candid feedback?</p>
<p>You can certainly experience a whole mixture of emotions before, during, and after 1:1 meetings. And even if you think you do &ldquo;quite fine&rdquo; in this area and know how to have effective 1:1s, we think it could be at least a bit better at Red Hat!</p>

<h2>The Invention of Zero: How Ancient Mesopotamia Created the Mathematical Concept of Nought and Ancient India Gave It Symbolic Form</h2>
<p class="author">By Maria Popova

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Central to humanity&rsquo;s quest to grasp the nature of the universe and make sense of our own existence is zero, which began in Mesopotamia and spurred one of the most significant paradigm shifts in human consciousness &mdash; a concept first invented (or perhaps discovered) in pre-Arab Sumer, modern-day Iraq, and later given symbolic form in ancient India.</p>
