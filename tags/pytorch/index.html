<h2>Benefits of Pranayama Based on Scientific Research</h2>
<p class="author">By Dr. Rishita Chandra

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Pranayama is about breathing science and having control over breathing brings many physical &amp; mental benefits. Controlled breathing by pranayama techniques lets you hold the horses of your mind, you keep calm, become able to think wisely, and make the correct decisions. It eventually makes you stress-free and happy. </p>

<h2>How To Break The “Senior Engineer” Career Ceiling</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Writing more code or releasing more features alone doesn&rsquo;t make you a better senior engineer. It&rsquo;s about your ability to deliver a meaningful business impact through your execution. This is the change in mindset that will set you on your way to the next level. </p>

<h2>Lessons learned managing the GitLab Data team</h2>
<p class="author">By Taylor A. Murphy

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>From April 2018 to May 2019 I was the manager of the Data team for GitLab. I took this role after my manager left, when I started reporting directly to the CFO as a Data Engineer. I remember saying to him &quot;this doesn't seem like the right level of abstraction for you,&quot; and proposed I step up to become the manager. I also said I didn't want to do this for a long period of time, since I intentionally came to GitLab to move from a manager role to an individual contributor role and focus on Data Engineering. What follows are a few lessons I learned (and relearned!) in my one-year stint as the manager of the Data team. Eventually, I aim to become a manager again and I hope to remember these lessons and learn even more. </p>

<h2>Managing Performance When It’s Hard to Measure</h2>
<p class="author">By Jim Whitehurst

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Organizations of all kinds have long struggled to accurately measure the performance of individual members. The typical approach is to assess an individual&rsquo;s performance against a metric usually tied to whether or not they performed a task and the amount of output they generated by doing so. There&rsquo;s a lot riding on these assessments: everything from compensation increases and bonus payments to promotions. And as anyone who has ever given or received a traditional performance review knows, this process can be highly subjective &mdash; even in the most metrics-obsessed organizations.</p>
<p>But what about the kinds of jobs where measuring someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;output&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about counting the number of widgets they produced, but rather it&rsquo;s about how they managed a team or influenced others or helped people collaborate better? While it might be easy to measure someone&rsquo;s output on an assembly line, how do we decide how well a manager manages or a leader leads?</p>

<h2>The Certainty of Failure</h2>
<p class="author">By marcgg

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Everyone makes mistakes, that should be a given. Knowing this, the question becomes not &ldquo;if&rdquo; one will slip, but &ldquo;when&rdquo;. Of course, experience and working hard can help in reducing the number of errors, but there&rsquo;s no way for someone to have an absolutely perfect track record.</p>

<h2>Weak Supervision: A New Programming Paradigm for Machine Learning</h2>
<p class="author">By Alex Ratner, Paroma Varma, Braden Hancock, Chris Ré, and other members of Hazy Lab

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In recent years, the real-world impact of machine learning (ML) has grown in leaps and bounds. In large part, this is due to the advent of deep learning models, which allow practitioners to get state-of-the-art scores on benchmark datasets without any hand-engineered features. Given the availability of multiple open-source ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and an abundance of available state-of-the-art models, it can be argued that high-quality ML models are almost a commoditized resource now. There is a hidden catch, however: the reliance of these models on massive sets of hand-labeled training data.</p>

<h2>Why feedback, not metrics, is critical to DevOps</h2>
<p class="author">By Ranjith Varakantam

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most managers and agile coaches depend on metrics over feedback from their teams, users, and even customers. In fact, quite a few use feedback and metrics synonymously, where they present feedback from teams or customers as a bunch of numbers or a graphical representation of those numbers. This is not only unfortunate, but it can be misleading as it presents only part of the story and not the entire truth.</p>
<p>When it comes to two critical factors&mdash;how we manage or guide our teams and how we operate and influence the product that our teams are developing&mdash;few exceptional leaders and teams get it right.&quot; (</p>

<h2>Why Visionary Leadership Fails</h2>
<p class="author">By Nufer Yasin Ates, Murat Tarakci, Jeanine P. Porck, Daan van Knippenberg, and Patrick Groenen

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Visionary leadership is widely seen as key to strategic change. That&rsquo;s because visionary leadership does not just set the strategic direction &mdash; it tells a story about why the change is worth pursuing and inspires people to embrace the change. Not surprisingly, then, science and practice have a very positive view of visionary leadership as a critical leadership competency.</p>
<p>But our research finds that the positive impact of visionary leadership breaks down when middle managers aren&rsquo;t aligned with top management&rsquo;s strategic vision. This can cause strategic change efforts to slow down or even fail.</p>
