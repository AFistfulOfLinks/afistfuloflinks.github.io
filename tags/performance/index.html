<h2>A 5-Point Framework For Python Performance Management</h2>
<p class="author">By Steven F. Lott

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In this post I want to outline a five-step process to managing performance testing. I think it’s helpful for Python applications, where performance is often brought up, but it applies widely. We’ll start the process with a definition of some use cases, then formalize them in Gherkin, review them with stakeholders, implement them in Python, and finally, make the whole thing an ongoing part of our deployment process.</p>

<h2>A theorem of software engineering</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;My aim is to popularize a result that is well known in the software engineering literature, going back to the early work of Barry Boehm [1], and explained with great clarity by Steve McConnell in his 2006 book on software cost estimation [2] under the name &ldquo;Shortest Possible Schedule&rdquo;. While an empirical rather than a logical result, I believe it deserves to be called a theorem (McConnell stays shy of using the term) because it is as close as we have in the area of software engineering management to a universal property, confirmed by numerous experimental studies.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>An Overview of Profiling Tools for Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Mike Driscoll

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The main idea behind benchmarking or profiling is to figure out how fast your code executes and where the bottlenecks are. The main reason to do this sort of thing is for optimization. You will run into situations where you need your code to run faster because your business needs have changed. When this happens, you will need to figure out which parts of your code are slowing it down.</p>

<h2>How to make your organization attractive to engineering talent</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Virtually everywhere I&rsquo;ve ever worked has always been desperate for good engineers. The bottleneck has never been &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have enough money to hire as many engineers as we want&rdquo;, the bottleneck is always on the supply-of-good-engineering-candidates side.</p>
<p>Good engineers of course tend to be not only employed but very well paid and well-taken-care-of in just about every way. It seems like most job ads I see these days tout unlimited PTO, catered meals, etc.&mdash;things that I never would have dreamed of when I got my first real programming job in 2005 but that are practically table stakes now.</p>
<p>In order to get a good engineer to leave his or her current well-paid and perked-to-the-max job, you have to offer that person something that&rsquo;s somehow better.</p>

<h2>Managing Performance When It’s Hard to Measure</h2>
<p class="author">By Jim Whitehurst

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Organizations of all kinds have long struggled to accurately measure the performance of individual members. The typical approach is to assess an individual&rsquo;s performance against a metric usually tied to whether or not they performed a task and the amount of output they generated by doing so. There&rsquo;s a lot riding on these assessments: everything from compensation increases and bonus payments to promotions. And as anyone who has ever given or received a traditional performance review knows, this process can be highly subjective &mdash; even in the most metrics-obsessed organizations.</p>
<p>But what about the kinds of jobs where measuring someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;output&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about counting the number of widgets they produced, but rather it&rsquo;s about how they managed a team or influenced others or helped people collaborate better? While it might be easy to measure someone&rsquo;s output on an assembly line, how do we decide how well a manager manages or a leader leads?</p>

<h2>Puppeteer vs Selenium vs Playwright, a speed comparison</h2>

    <p>Determining which automation tool is <em>generally</em> faster is far from simple. Therefore we decided to run our own benchmarks to see how newcomers Puppeteer and Playwright measured against the veteran WebDriverIO (using Selenium <em>and</em> the DevTools automation protocols). Among the results of our benchmark were also some <strong>unexpected findings</strong>, like Puppeteer being significantly faster on shorter scripts and WebDriverIO showing larger than expected variability in the longer scenarios.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>TThe debate about feedback at work isn&rsquo;t new. Since at least the middle of the last century, the question of how to get employees to improve has generated a good deal of opinion and research. But recently the discussion has taken on new intensity. The ongoing experiment in &ldquo;radical transparency&rdquo; at Bridgewater Associates and the culture at Netflix, which the Wall Street Journal recently described as &ldquo;encouraging harsh feedback&rdquo; and subjecting workers to &ldquo;intense and awkward&rdquo; real-time 360s, are but two examples of the overriding belief that the way to increase performance in companies is through rigorous, frequent, candid, pervasive, and often critical feedback.</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Python programmers almost never implement the Singleton Pattern as described in the Gang of Four book, whose Singleton class forbids normal instantiation and instead offers a class method that returns the singleton instance. Python is more elegant, and lets a class continue to support the normal syntax for instantiation while defining a custom __new__() method that returns the singleton instance. But an even more Pythonic approach, if your design forces you to offer global access to a singleton object, is to use The Global Object Pattern instead.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Unit Testing React Components</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Unit testing is a great discipline which can lead to 40%-80% reductions in production bug density. Unit testing also has several other important benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves your application architecture and maintainability.</li>
<li>Leads to better APIs and composability by focusing developers on the developer experience (API) before implementation details.</li>
<li>Provides quick feedback on file-save to tell you whether or not your changes worked. This can replace console.log()and clicking around in the UI to test changes. Newcomers to unit testing might spend an extra 15% - 30% on the TDD process as they figure out how to test various components, but experienced TDD practitioners may experience savings in implementation time using TDD.</li>
<li>Provides a great safety net which can enhance your confidence when its time to add features or refactor existing features.</li>
</ul>
<p>But some things are easier to unit test than others. Specifically, unit tests work great for pure functions: Functions which given the same input, always return the same output, and have no side-effects.</p>

<h2>Weak Supervision: A New Programming Paradigm for Machine Learning</h2>

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In recent years, the real-world impact of machine learning (ML) has grown in leaps and bounds. In large part, this is due to the advent of deep learning models, which allow practitioners to get state-of-the-art scores on benchmark datasets without any hand-engineered features. Given the availability of multiple open-source ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and an abundance of available state-of-the-art models, it can be argued that high-quality ML models are almost a commoditized resource now. There is a hidden catch, however: the reliance of these models on massive sets of hand-labeled training data.</p>

    <p>Most managers and agile coaches depend on metrics over feedback from their teams, users, and even customers. In fact, quite a few use feedback and metrics synonymously, where they present feedback from teams or customers as a bunch of numbers or a graphical representation of those numbers. This is not only unfortunate, but it can be misleading as it presents only part of the story and not the entire truth.</p>
<p>When it comes to two critical factors&mdash;how we manage or guide our teams and how we operate and influence the product that our teams are developing&mdash;few exceptional leaders and teams get it right.&quot; (</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Almost all employees crave feedback. But when the accolades start rolling in, many get embarrassed, sink into their seat, look away or even try to negate or reject the compliment.</p>
<p>But it's important not to do that. How employees receive and acknowledge praise and positive feedback can impact work relationships and career growth.</p>

<h2>Why Visionary Leadership Fails</h2>
<p class="author">By Nufer Yasin Ates, Murat Tarakci, Jeanine P. Porck, Daan van Knippenberg, and Patrick Groenen

    <p>Visionary leadership is widely seen as key to strategic change. That&rsquo;s because visionary leadership does not just set the strategic direction &mdash; it tells a story about why the change is worth pursuing and inspires people to embrace the change. Not surprisingly, then, science and practice have a very positive view of visionary leadership as a critical leadership competency.</p>
<p>But our research finds that the positive impact of visionary leadership breaks down when middle managers aren&rsquo;t aligned with top management&rsquo;s strategic vision. This can cause strategic change efforts to slow down or even fail.</p>
