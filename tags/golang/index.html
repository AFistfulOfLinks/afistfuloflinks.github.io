<h2>Application-Driven API Design</h2>
<p class="author">By Stephen Mizell

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When designing APIs, it&rsquo;s important to take a design-first approach to ensure the right API gets built. However, I don&rsquo;t think the first step should be to write an OpenAPI or API Blueprint document. I think it should be to design a working application.</p>

<h2>Effective Feedback - Is it Possible?</h2>
<p class="author">By Frank Jansen

- Submitted by <a href="https://alexis.monville.com/en/" class="submitter">Alexis Monville</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A recent Harvard Business Review (HBR) article appears to indicate that candid feedback should be avoided; in The Feedback Fallacy, the authors stipulate that this kind of feedback may be damaging. The authors' reference to the current excitement over apps based on 'Radical Candor' and the tendency toward direct, sometimes harsh feedback that is being promoted at a number of companies, seems to lead us away from that approach. But does it?</p>

<h2>Functional Programming in Scala Specialization</h2>
<p class="author">By Coursera

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. You'll see how the functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large; from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark. A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.</p>

<h2>The Forgotten Woman Who Discovered the Greenhouse Effect</h2>
<p class="author">By Ian Steadman

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When did we realize that more carbon dioxide equals a hotter planet? You could go all the way back to 1827, when French mathematician Joseph Fourier calculated that the atmosphere, somehow, was keeping the planet warm like a blanket. Or you could go as late as 1938, when British engineer Guy Stewart Callendar gathered data for the first time to show that the Earth was already getting warmer in line with emissions.</p>
<p><br>
But over the last decade, a new answer has come to light: 1856. That&rsquo;s when amateur American scientist Eunice Foote discovered what we now call the greenhouse effect. Yet we know very little about her. We don&rsquo;t even know what she looked like.</p>
