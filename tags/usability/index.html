<h2>Another Side of-- Scott Fitzgerald?</h2>
<p class="author">By Sally Koslow

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Do you remember your first F. Scott Fitzgerald? How you realized there was something more to literature, a voice, a time, a glamor? And then you heard about Zelda, and the Jazz Age, and Gatsby, and the beautiful shirts? And thought about why Nick Carraway was named that, and what Scott&rsquo;s life was really like, and whether it would have been amazing or tragic?<br>
Sally Koslow explored, absorbed, researched and recreated&mdash;and brings us&mdash;lucky us&mdash;a wonderful narrative biography into one part of Scott Fitzgerald&rsquo;s life.</p>

<h2>Bored People Quit</h2>

    <p>We talk a lot about associate success and retention and when I came across this article I found it to be a good read, not just for managers but individual contributors as well.  Because we (Red Hat) tell our employees that they own their careers I found the &quot;They tell you. And you listen&quot; to be quite important. </p>

<h2>Building a First Team Mindset</h2>
<p class="author">By Jason Wong

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A First Team mindset is the idea that leaders prioritize supporting their fellow leaders over supporting their direct reports&mdash;that they are responsible to their peers more than they are to their individual teams. If you&rsquo;re not entirely onboard with that concept, I get it. It took me a while to come around to it myself.</p>

<h2>Extracting Super Mario Bros levels with Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Matthew Earl

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For an upcoming project, I need to extract level data from the classic 1985 video game Super Mario Bros (SMB). More precisely, I want to extract the background imagery for each stage of the game, excluding HUD elements and moving sprites, etc. Of course, I could just stitch together images from the game, and perhaps automate this process with computer vision techniques. But I think the method described below is more interesting, and allows for inspection of elements of the level perhaps not exposed through screenshots. </p>

<h2>Make. It. Simple. Linux Desktop Usability</h2>
<p class="author">By probono

- Submitted by Pete Savage

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Why do desktop environments increasingly degrade the desktop UX that once used to be straightforward and &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;? Is there a secret plan to cripple the desktop experience by infecting it with less suitable UX concepts invented for mobile phones? In this series, I will look at recent worrisome trends in desktop Linux usability and contrast them with the thoughts of the very inventors of the desktop metaphor as we know it. </p>

<h2>On Solving Bigger Problems in Life</h2>
<p class="author">By Chris Castiglione

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Last month, while reading Harvard Business Review&rsquo;s book On Strategy, I came across the concept of a Big Hairy Audacious Goal - often shorthanded as BHAG - which refers to life-goals that are beyond the limits of what seems possible.</p>

<h2>Optimize for readability first</h2>

<h2>Rating the Severity of Usability Problems</h2>
<p class="author">By Jeff Sauro

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>If only one out of 1000 users encounters a problem with a website, then it&rsquo;s a minor problem.</p>
<p>If that sentence bothered you, it should.</p>
<p>It could be that that single problem resulted in one visitor&rsquo;s financial information inadvertently being posted to the website for the world to see.</p>
<p>Or it could be a slight hesitation with a label on an obscure part of a website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the responsibility of user experience professionals to help developers make decisions about what to fix.</p>
<p>Accounting for problem frequency and severity are two critical ingredients when communicating the importance of usability problems.</p>

<h2>Taming Irreversibility with Feature Flags (in Python)</h2>
<p class="author">By Hugo Bessa

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Feature Flags are a very simple technique to make features of your application quickly toggleable. The way it works is, everytime we change some behavior in our software, a logical branch is created and this new behavior is only accessible if some specific configuration variable is set or, in certain cases, if the application context respects some rules.</p>
