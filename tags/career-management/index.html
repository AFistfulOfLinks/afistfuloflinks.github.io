<h2>Colossal Cave Adventure: Building and running 40-year-old code from the dawn of gaming</h2>
<p class="author">By Doug Tidewell

<p>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.<br>
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building<br>
and down a gully.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? If you&rsquo;re an old-school gamer, you&rsquo;ve probably seen these words hundreds of times. They&rsquo;re the starting point for Colossal Cave Adventure, the first major computer game. It was created in 1977 by Willie Crowther and Don Woods and quickly became a phenomenon in those pre-GUI, pre-Internet years. What helped the game spread from one data center to another was the fact that the source code was freely available.</p>
<p>The last version of the code from the original authors was written in 1995, and if you&rsquo;re like us, you're hearing this story and wondering where that code is now. With the encouragement and permission of the authors, open source pioneer Eric S. Raymond has ported the code to his GitLab account. In this article, we&rsquo;ll show you how to build and run that code.</p>

<h2>Dockerizing modern web apps</h2>
<p class="author">By Hendrik

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most websites these days are Single Page Applications (SPA for short) where a single entry file handles all routes that a user might visit. Swept up in the ongoing trend of hosting in the cloud you might find yourself needing to &ldquo;dockerize&rdquo; your SPA. That is to say wrap it inside a Docker image and run it as a container. In this post we will explore how we can get that done.</p>

<h2>Google asked 5,600 employees about remote work. This is what they learned</h2>
<p class="author">By Ruth Reader

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>On the outset of the study, the team hypothesized that distributed teams might not be as productive as their centrally located counterparts. &ldquo;We were a little nervous about that,&rdquo; says Gilrane. She was surprised to find that distributed teams performed just as well. Unfortunately, she also found that there is a lot more frustration involved in working remotely. Workers in other offices can sometimes feel burdened to sync up their schedules with the main office. They can also feel disconnected from the team.</p>

<h2>The Career Management Secret I Wish I Had Known in My Twenties</h2>
<p class="author">By David Cancel

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I used to have these meetings with Dave Gerhardt (DG). Back then, DG was the only marketer and he had just joined the team, so I was explaining to him how he could set himself up to grow as the company was growing. And I said that what happens is, usually, if a company is growing quickly, if they&rsquo;re experiencing hypergrowth, that company will end up growing faster than the individual.</p>

<h2>Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.</h2>

<h2>Your Productivity Hinges on How You Arrange Your Desk</h2>
<p class="author">By Alli Hoff Kosik

- Submitted by Daniel Gur

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>IfÂ your job requires you to sit at a desk, you probably spend more waking hours at that desk each day than you do in your own home (or in any other part of your home, if that&rsquo;s where you work from). If you love your job, this may not seem like such a bad thing, but it&rsquo;s still worth maximizing your small space for ultimate productivity.<br>
We asked design and productivity experts for advice on how best to structure, organize, and decorate your desk to create a workspace that serves you, keeps you on task, and makes you feel good about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
