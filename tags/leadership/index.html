<h2>6 Steps Leaders Can Take to Get the Most Out of Feedback</h2>
<p class="author">By Jennifer Porter

- Submitted by Karel Piwko

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Business publications are filled with articles about feedback: how important it is for leaders, how leaders can both give and receive it, what happens when leaders don&rsquo;t get it, and even what to do if someone is not open to feedback they have been given. The focus tends to be on the transfer of data.</p>
<p>What is less explored is how leaders should respond once they receive that data. Through our work coaching thousands of leaders across industries, my colleagues and I have found that, even when leaders make an effort to collect robust feedback, they only access about 25% of its potential value.</p>

    <p>Setting up test cases for code that manage data can be challenging but it's an important skill to reliably test your code. You might have heard of the setup and teardown methods in unittest. In pytest you use fixtures and as you will discover in this article they are actually not that hard to set up. Fixtures have been labelled pytest's killer feature so let's explore them in this article using a practical example.</p>

<h2>Becoming a team lead: a survival guide</h2>

    <p>The reason this is a survival guide is because after spending my entire career as a software engineer, I was thrown into a team lead role without much warning. I had no idea what I was doing and had very little support. This is the survival guide I wish I had. It documents my experiences as an inexperienced team lead &ndash;as an engineer transitioning to a team lead&ndash; and my learnings &amp; mistakes along the way. Hopefully this can act as a survival guide for you, too. </p>

<h2>Breaking the Test Case Addiction (Part 6)</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the last installment, we ended by asking &ldquo;Once the tester has learned something about the product, how can you focus a tester&rsquo;s work without over-focusing it?</p>
<p>I provided some examples in Part 4 of this series. Here&rsquo;s another: scenario testing. The examples I&rsquo;ll provide here are based on work done by James Bach and Geordie Keitt several years ago. (I&rsquo;ve helped several other organizations apply this approach much more recently, but they&rsquo;re less willing to share details.)</p>
<p>The idea is to use scenarios to guide the tester to explore, experiment, and get experience with the product, acting on ideas about real-world use and about how the product might foreseeably be misused.</p>

<h2>Collection Pipeline</h2>
<p class="author">By Martin Fowler

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Collection pipelines are a programming pattern where you organize some computation as a sequence of operations which compose by taking a collection as output of one operation and feeding it into the next. (Common operations are filter, map, and reduce.) This pattern is common in functional programming, and also in object-oriented languages which have lambdas. This article describes the pattern with several examples of how to form pipelines, both to introduce the pattern to those unfamiliar with it, and to help people understand the core concepts so they can more easily take ideas from one language to another.</p>

    <p>When Sherlock Holmes first meets Dr John Watson, he identifies the physician's background at a glance. To many, that moment in Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet (1887) &mdash; Holmes's debut &mdash; is a smile-worthy flight of fancy. Except it isn't entirely fantastical. One of Conan Doyle's mentors at the University of Edinburgh, UK, where he trained as an ophthalmologist, was the surgeon Joseph Bell. And it's to him that we owe the famed exchange about Afghanistan, as well as much of Holmes's character.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this idea that, if you do great work at your job, people will (or should!) automatically recognize that work and reward you for it with promotions / increased pay. In practice, it&rsquo;s often more complicated than that &ndash; some kinds of important work are more visible/memorable than others. It&rsquo;s frustrating to have done something really important and later realize that you didn&rsquo;t get rewarded for it just because the people making the decision didn&rsquo;t understand or remember what you did. So I want to talk about a tactic that I and lots of people I work with have used!&rdquo; </p>

    <p>GitOps lowers the bar for creating self-service versions of common IT (or site reliability engineering, or DevOps) processes. As the bar is lowered, it becomes easier to meet the return in the ROI (return on investment) calculation.</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We're several months into the work at the firm, and one very interesting concept has come to the fore: The implementation of preemptive change is about desire. Or, as one senior leader proffered at a recent executive steering committee meeting, &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it.&quot; I love this statement: &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it!&quot; It's a straightforward way to summarize an otherwise elegant management philosophy -- one that connotes desire, focus, and a commitment to change. In the interest of furthering this theory, let me propose five basic leadership principles we can use to form the backbone of the &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it&quot; philosophy. </p>

    <p>Four years ago, I was coming back to work from my first maternity leave, and was working 3 days a week. Week after week, I kept my head down and got my coding tasks done in my limited time in the office.</p>
<p>Soon it became crystal clear to me that even if I did this incredibly well &mdash; as well as I possibly could &mdash; I wouldn&rsquo;t be given the opportunity to lead a team or to do more strategic work. I would just get more coding tasks assigned to me. At that point, I could see that what I was doing wouldn&rsquo;t get me to where I wanted, but I also didn&rsquo;t know what I should do instead. So here&rsquo;s the post I wish I had read then.</p>

<h2>Managing Performance When It’s Hard to Measure</h2>
<p class="author">By Jim Whitehurst

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Organizations of all kinds have long struggled to accurately measure the performance of individual members. The typical approach is to assess an individual&rsquo;s performance against a metric usually tied to whether or not they performed a task and the amount of output they generated by doing so. There&rsquo;s a lot riding on these assessments: everything from compensation increases and bonus payments to promotions. And as anyone who has ever given or received a traditional performance review knows, this process can be highly subjective &mdash; even in the most metrics-obsessed organizations.</p>
<p>But what about the kinds of jobs where measuring someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;output&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about counting the number of widgets they produced, but rather it&rsquo;s about how they managed a team or influenced others or helped people collaborate better? While it might be easy to measure someone&rsquo;s output on an assembly line, how do we decide how well a manager manages or a leader leads?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>One of the most common steps in defining titles when a company is hitting its growth stage is adding &lsquo;Senior&rsquo; to the moniker of engineer but soon enough, especially if retention is good and people are staying on board a number of years, companies realize they need more than just a 2 level engineering ladder. This is where titles like &lsquo;principal&rsquo; or &lsquo;staff&rsquo; engineer become part of the defined career ladder. However, principal engineer should not be seen as a natural progression to senior engineering levels.</p>

    <p>Code reviews are a popular method of catching bugs early in development through peer-reviewing someone&rsquo;s code. But perhaps more important than catching bugs, these reviews also serve as a chance to see how something is built and have a conversation about it. Because testers question software differently from developers, it&rsquo;s important that we participate in this knowledge-sharing practice.</p>

    <p>People associate running pods with Kubernetes. And when they run containers in their development runtimes, they do not even think about the role pods could play&mdash;even in a localized runtime. Most people coming from the Docker world of running single containers do not envision the concept of running pods. There are several good reasons to consider using pods locally, other than using pods to naturally group your containers.</p>

<h2>Reporting Automated Test Results Effectively</h2>
<p class="author">By Ajeet Dhaliwal

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The modern iterative software development lifecycle has developers checking in code to version control systems frequently, with continuous integration handling building and running automated tests at an almost equally fast rate. This can generate an enormous amount of test data. Here&rsquo;s how you can ensure you are reporting results effectively across your team and realizing all the benefits of that information.</p>

<h2>Screaming Architecture</h2>
<p class="author">By Uncle Bob

- Submitted by <a href="https://elyezer.com/" class="submitter">Elyezer Rezende</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A good software architecture allows decisions about frameworks, databases, web-servers, and other environmental issues and tools, to be deferred and delayed. A good architecture makes it unnecessary to decide on Rails, or Spring, or Hibernate, or Tomcat or MySql, until much later in the project. A good architecture makes it easy to change your mind about those decisions too. A good architecture emphasizes the use-cases and decouples them from peripheral concerns. </p>

<h2>Selecting project leads</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Have you ever worked at a company where the same two people always got the most important projects? Me too. It's frustrating to watch these opportunities to learn from the side lines, and reliance on a small group can easily limit a company's throughput as it grows. This is so important that I've come to believe that having a wide cohort of folks who lead critical projects is one of the most important signifiers of good organizational health.</p>

<h2>The Mind at Work: Ted Chiang on making stories that change our minds</h2>
<p class="author">By Anthony Wing Kosner

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Why do we tell stories? And why in a world with such an overabundance of information is there even room for fiction? Access to information has made our jobs increasingly data-driven and would appear to put a premium on being factual. But unlike industrial labor, knowledge work, for all of its data, is much harder to measure, and stories are a proven method for trying on alternate realities that we may or may not want to manifest. We tell stories so that other people can imagine an experience we want to share. Without fiction, there are no new ideas. Even a scientific theory is fictional until proven.</p>

<h2>Three crucial skills that leaders must develop to become executives</h2>
<p class="author">By Nikhyl Singhal

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Becoming a great executive requires a set of skills beyond what&rsquo;s needed to be a leader. Executive skills are subtle and can be elusive to managers, demanding a great deal of focus, courage, and dedication. These skills include taking (almost irrational) career risk, learning to scale by trusting your team, and developing advanced soft skills. New skills are hard for leaders to develop simply because they’ve already found success, which makes them less motivated to make substantive skill shifts. But those who see change as a path to growth will ascend to top roles within an organization.</p>

    <p>I recently gave a workshop on &quot;TDD in Python with pytest&quot;, where I developed a very simple Python project together with the attendees following a TDD approach. It's a good way to introduce TDD, I think. I wrote each test together with the attendees, and then I left them the task of writing the Python code that passes the test. This way I could show TDD in action, introducing pytest features like the pytest.raises context manager or the use of assert while they become useful for the actual tests.</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In recent years, the real-world impact of machine learning (ML) has grown in leaps and bounds. In large part, this is due to the advent of deep learning models, which allow practitioners to get state-of-the-art scores on benchmark datasets without any hand-engineered features. Given the availability of multiple open-source ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and an abundance of available state-of-the-art models, it can be argued that high-quality ML models are almost a commoditized resource now. There is a hidden catch, however: the reliance of these models on massive sets of hand-labeled training data.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Visionary leadership is widely seen as key to strategic change. That&rsquo;s because visionary leadership does not just set the strategic direction &mdash; it tells a story about why the change is worth pursuing and inspires people to embrace the change. Not surprisingly, then, science and practice have a very positive view of visionary leadership as a critical leadership competency.</p>
<p>But our research finds that the positive impact of visionary leadership breaks down when middle managers aren&rsquo;t aligned with top management&rsquo;s strategic vision. This can cause strategic change efforts to slow down or even fail.</p>
