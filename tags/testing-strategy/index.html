<h2>Bad Test Strategies and How You Can Avoid Them</h2>
<p class="author">By Dennis Martinez

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A good test strategy will help avoid confusion and problems with your team through the project&rsquo;s life cycle by clarifying what the organization wants to accomplish regarding quality. (&hellip;) A bad test strategy is a massive detriment to the project, the organization, and the team. (&hellip;) I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s worse than having no strategy at all because it&rsquo;s driving people in the wrong direction and makes it more challenging to course-correct when the project is going off the rails.</p>

<h2>Creating a Test Strategy</h2>
<p class="author">By Huib Schoots

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The goal of full day workshop was to teach to create a Test Strategy rapidly so you can start testing as soon as possible. This blog post describes the summary of what we taught and publishes the example I made for the participants.</p>

<h2>Don&#39;t Start Your Automation Strategy With Tools</h2>
<p class="author">By Dennis Martinez

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Of course, you need tools to accomplish whatever you set out to do. You can&rsquo;t record a podcast without a mic, say something in a different language without reading or hearing it somewhere, or write an automated test without knowing how to code or use a codeless automation tool. However, starting your test automation efforts with tooling is a big mistake I&rsquo;ve seen repeatedly.</p>

<h2>Unit Testing is Overrated</h2>
<p class="author">By Alexey Golub

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better. It was only later, as I&rsquo;ve experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that <strong>focusing on unit tests is</strong>, in most cases, <strong>a complete waste of time</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why Most Unit Testing is Waste</h2>
<p class="author">By James O Coplien

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Object orientation turned the design world upside-down. First, the design units changed from things-that-computed to small heterogeneous composites called objects that combine several programming artefacts, including functions and data, together inside one wrapper. (&hellip;) That made it impossible to reason about run-time behaviour of code by inspection alone. You had to run the program to get the faintest idea of what was going on. So, testing became <em>in</em> again. <a href="https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf">Original PDF version of article</a></p>
