    <p>I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.</p>
<p>Why is knowing how to learn so important? The answer is simple: as languages evolve, libraries are created, and tools are upgraded. Knowing how to learn will be essential to keeping up with these changes and becoming a successful programmer.</p>
<p>In this article, we will offer several learning strategies that will help jump start your journey of becoming a rockstar Python programmer!</p>

<h2>5 reasons you should learn Lua</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you haven't heard of Lua, it's a really small programming language. Maybe you have heard of it, but never had a reason to learn it because your programming language of choice does everything you need it to. Well, here are a few reasons you should learn Lua anyway.</p>

<h2>An Approach To Automating Application Resiliency Testing With Kubernetes</h2>

    <p>Looking globally at the resiliency aspect of an architecture creates different opportunities, like providing a different user experience, scaling and supporting heavier loads, and generally, building a more robust system.</p>

<h2>Learn New Technology as a Way of Stepping Up Your Understanding of Your Current One</h2>
<p class="author">By Ben Halpern

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>One common question for software developers is how to progress from 'intermediate' to 'senior'&mdash;whatever those titles mean. A lot of the journey is how you position yourself and stay confident, but in terms of taking these leaps in your own capacity as a technologist, I have a thought on the subject.</p>

<h2>Rather Than a Micromanager or Absentee Manager, Be a Thought Partner</h2>
<p class="author">By Kim Scott

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;We call managers who have low, almost non-existent involvement in their team&rsquo;s work absentee managers. Those with extremely (maybe excruciatingly) close involvement are micromanagers. And in between those are the thought partners, the ones who empower, enable and encourage their teams to do the best work of their lives. How can you determine where you fall on this spectrum so you can learn how to move in the right direction instead of being a micromanager or an absentee manager?</p>

<h2>There is no Agile Quality Engineering</h2>

<h2>Why I Left Management: the engineering technical track vs. management track</h2>
<p class="author">By Joy Ebertz

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When advancing in an engineering career, at some point, the question will come up of if you&rsquo;re interested in the technical track or the management track. Different people thrive on different tracks and many people move back and forth between the two, some of them multiple times. While at many companies, good engineers are promoted to become engineering managers, the jobs are actually very different, and it&rsquo;s worth considering what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into and if it&rsquo;s a position in which you can thrive. As I made the transition into management and ultimately back, I learned some things about myself and how I operate.</p>
