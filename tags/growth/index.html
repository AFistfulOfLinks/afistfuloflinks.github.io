<h2>Don&#39;t Work Alone When You&#39;re a New or Junior Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By Gergely Orosz

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;One of the recurring things that come to bite me and my team is having a less experienced engineer or new joiner work completely alone on a project for weeks or months. We&rsquo;ve done this multiple times, and the results were always similarly dire. The engineer ends up building something slightly - or very - different than what we intended to. They took a lot longer to do it - and their morale was down, due to feeling lonely and unproductive this time. They did make mistakes, but did not have anyone give them feedback, to learn from it. Every time we sat down and did a retrospective on what to do different, next time, we agreed on the same thing: have someone to work with from the start.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>How to offer challenges to your teammates</h2>
<p class="author">By Lara Hogan

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Think about when a manager&rsquo;s helped skyrocket your growth&mdash;what did they do? Did they teach you a new skill? Did they give you hard feedback?</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, when I ask this question to groups of workshop attendees, people describe a time when a manager sponsored them for a visible (and often scary) stretch assignment. An assignment that these workshop participants didn&rsquo;t exactly know how to do, and it felt fairly high stakes&mdash;but their manager trusted they could do it, for some reason. This trust, and this stretchy project, helped them grow exponentially.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Reading for Programmers</h2>
<p class="author">By Piotr Limanowski

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>TD;DR: Use a three-pass (verify-grasp-analyse) reading algorithm and get comfortable with reading hundreds of papers. Use org-mode (w/ helm-bibtex, org-ref and interleave) and keep the notes in check.</p>

<h2>The Danger of “Simplicity”</h2>
<p class="author">By asthasr

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Who hasn&rsquo;t shaved a yak? Still, the ultimate purpose of programming as a profession or hobby is clear: we want to apply the raw power of computation to a problem, and know that the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve written can be trusted to solve the problem we think that it does. Code, in itself, is not an asset. A solved problem is an asset.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>When Executives Break</h2>
<p class="author">By Elad Gil

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When your company is scaling rapidly due to product market fit, one of the biggest impediments (or boosters) to growth will turn out to be the composition of your executive team. If your executives are not able to scale with the company, entire functions may be thrown into disarray and your adoption or revenue may stop scaling.</p>

<h2>Your Professional Growth Questionnaire</h2>
<p class="author">By &#34;Rands&#34;

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For many of the companies I&rsquo;ve worked at for the past three decades, performance season is three weeks once a year. More progressive companies have a major performance cycle per year with a minor one six months after the major to capture one-off promotions for exceptional, errors in job leveling at hiring, and other performance housekeeping tasks that can&rsquo;t wait another six months.</p>
