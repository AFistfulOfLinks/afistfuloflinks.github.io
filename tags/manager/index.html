<h2>On Being a Senior Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By John Allspaw

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>What does it actually mean to be &lsquo;senior&rsquo; in this discipline? I certainly have an opinion of what it means, given that I&rsquo;m charged with hiring, supporting, and retaining engineers whom are deemed to be senior. This notion that there is a bar to be passed in terms of career development is a good one, but I&rsquo;d also add that these criteria exist on a spectrum, as opposed to a simple list of check-boxes. You don&rsquo;t wake up one day and you are &ldquo;senior&rdquo; just because your title reflects that upon a promotion. Senior engineers don&rsquo;t know everything. They&rsquo;re not perfect in their technical knowledge, and they&rsquo;re OK with that.</p>

<h2>Should You Become a Manager?</h2>
<p class="author">By Cap Watkins

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Since starting my own business as a leadership coach, I&rsquo;ve spoken with a lot of folks who are at a crossroads in their careers. Should they become a manager, or should they continue to pursue excellence in their craft? Are those paths mutually exclusive? If not, how can they do both?</p>
<p>For many, this can be a very nebulous, stressful decision. There are only a few people I&rsquo;ve spoken with who&rsquo;ve known without a shadow of a doubt which path they wanted to take (I was not one of them, surprisingly).</p>

<h2>Who Are the Forgotten Greats of Science Fiction?</h2>
<p class="author">By James Davis Nicoll

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Time is nobody&rsquo;s friend. Authors in particular can fall afoul of time&mdash;all it takes is a few years out of the limelight. Publishers will let their books fall out of print; readers will forget about them. Replace &ldquo;years&rdquo; with &ldquo;decades&rdquo; and authors can become very obscure indeed.</p>

<h2>Why Do Employees Resist Change?</h2>
<p class="author">By Paul Strebel

- Submitted by <a href="https://mirekdlugosz.com/" class="submitter">Miroslaw Dlugosz-Zalewski</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The scenario is all too familiar. Company leaders talk about total quality management, downsizing, or customer value. Determined managers follow up with plans for process improvements in customer service, manufacturing, and supply chain management, and for new organizations to fit the new processes. From subordinates, management looks for enthusiasm, acceptance, and commitment. But it gets something less. Communication breaks down, implementation plans miss their mark, and results fall short. This happens often enough that we have to ask why, and how we can avoid these failures.</p>
