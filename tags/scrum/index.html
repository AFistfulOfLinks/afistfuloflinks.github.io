<h2>Advice: What to do when you’re a woman and a man ignores you in a meeting</h2>
<p class="author">By Robin Abrahams

- Submitted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cswiii" class="submitter">Corey Welton</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A younger, male colleague and I were recently assessing a university unit as volunteers for a professional association. We met with two supervising faculty, an older man (Professor X) and a woman about my age. Throughout the meeting X angled himself toward my colleague, and rarely let the other woman answer any questions. At the end, he asked my colleague questions about his background, but did not ask me, a woman, about mine. What did I do to render myself invisible or less powerful? Does taking notes in a steno pad make me appear to be a secretary? I asked my share of questions, but not the first question. Was that a mistake? Was I right to just let it go and use it as a teachable moment with my students?</p>

<h2>Are you being micro-managed? Manage your relationship with your manager instead</h2>
<p class="author">By Osman Ahmed Osman

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Being micromanaged sucks. It&rsquo;s a major complaint people have with their managers. You feel demotivated and undervalued, and it inhibits your own learning.</p>

<h2>Cheap Stuff To Hack: A Router With An SDR For $13</h2>
<p class="author">By Brian Benchoff

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The history of consumer electronics is littered with devices that are relatively uninteresting at first, but become spectacular platforms for hardware exploitation once a few select people figure out how everything ticks. The Linksys WRT54G was just a router until someone figured out how to put a complete Linux system on them.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a new device sitting on the shelves at Walmart just waiting for some Linux hackers to have a go. It&rsquo;s the Tzumi MagicTV, a device that allows you to watch over-the-air television on your phone.</p>

<h2>On Managing Your Friends</h2>
<p class="author">By Jennifer Dary

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>You used to be peers. You talked over lunch about your days, you rolled your eyes together about That Person on the team&hellip; and now you&rsquo;ve been asked to manage the team. Now not only are you in charge of That Person&rsquo;s career path, you&rsquo;re also responsible for your friend&rsquo;s performance reviews, too.</p>
