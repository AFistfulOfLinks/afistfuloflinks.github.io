<h2>An awesome new Python profiler: py-spy!</h2>
<p class="author">By Julia Evans

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The other day I learned that Ben Frederickson has written an awesome new Python profiler called py-spy!</p>
<p>It takes a similar approach to profiling as rbspy, the profiler I worked on earlier this year &ndash; it can profile any running Python program, it uses process_vm_readv to read memory, and it by default displays profiling information in a really easy-to-use way.</p>

<h2>Another Side of-- Scott Fitzgerald?</h2>
<p class="author">By Sally Koslow

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Do you remember your first F. Scott Fitzgerald? How you realized there was something more to literature, a voice, a time, a glamor? And then you heard about Zelda, and the Jazz Age, and Gatsby, and the beautiful shirts? And thought about why Nick Carraway was named that, and what Scott&rsquo;s life was really like, and whether it would have been amazing or tragic?<br>
Sally Koslow explored, absorbed, researched and recreated&mdash;and brings us&mdash;lucky us&mdash;a wonderful narrative biography into one part of Scott Fitzgerald&rsquo;s life.</p>

<h2>Application-Driven API Design</h2>

    <p>When designing APIs, it&rsquo;s important to take a design-first approach to ensure the right API gets built. However, I don&rsquo;t think the first step should be to write an OpenAPI or API Blueprint document. I think it should be to design a working application.</p>

<h2>Delivering on an architecture strategy</h2>
<p class="author">By Pete Hodgson

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Software companies always have an unended stream of product features for engineers to work on. One of the most important responsibilities of a technology leader is to carve out space so that engineers can also perform the technical work which keeps the architectural foundations of a product healthy. Just as product leadership are responsible for defining a vision for a product and leading towards it, tech leadership is responsible for defining a vision for architecture, and leading towards that.</p>

<h2>Effective Feedback - Is it Possible?</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A recent Harvard Business Review (HBR) article appears to indicate that candid feedback should be avoided; in The Feedback Fallacy, the authors stipulate that this kind of feedback may be damaging. The authors' reference to the current excitement over apps based on 'Radical Candor' and the tendency toward direct, sometimes harsh feedback that is being promoted at a number of companies, seems to lead us away from that approach. But does it?</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Loops of exploration, experimentation, studying, modeling, and learning are the essence of testing, not an add-on to it. The intersection of activity and models (such as the Heuristic Test Strategy Model) help us to perform testing while continuously developing, refining, and reviewing it. Testing is much more than writing a bunch of automated checks to confirm that the product can do something; it&rsquo;s an ongoing investigation in which we continuously develop our understanding of the product.</p>

<h2>How to design a RESTful API architecture from a human-language spec</h2>
<p class="author">By Filipe XimenesFlÃ¡vio Juvenal

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Like almost all software, an API needs to reflect the needs of the humans who interact with it. An API is somewhat different from a GUI or other user interface because it interacts with a programmer rather than directly with the end user. However, the principles of designing for the user still apply: you must think of the background knowledge brought by the programmers and the constraints under which they are operating, such as the bandwidth of mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis in Python</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>According to Wikipedia:<br>
Â Â Â In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.</p>
<p><br>
You can say that EDA is statisticians way of story telling where you explore data, find patterns and tells insights. Often you have some questions in hand you try to validate those questions by performing EDA.</p>

<h2>On Pair Programming</h2>
<p class="author">By Martin Fowler

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many people who work in software development today have heard of the practice of pair programming, yet it still only has patchy adoption in the industry. One reason for its varying acceptance is that its benefits are not immediately obvious, it pays off more in the medium- and long-term. And it's also not as simple as &quot;two people working at a single computer&quot;, so many dismiss it quickly when it feels uncomfortable. However, in our experience, pair programming is vital for collaborative teamwork and high-quality software.</p>

<h2>The Forgotten Woman Who Discovered the Greenhouse Effect</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>When did we realize that more carbon dioxide equals a hotter planet? You could go all the way back to 1827, when French mathematician Joseph Fourier calculated that the atmosphere, somehow, was keeping the planet warm like a blanket. Or you could go as late as 1938, when British engineer Guy Stewart Callendar gathered data for the first time to show that the Earth was already getting warmer in line with emissions.</p>
<p><br>
But over the last decade, a new answer has come to light: 1856. That&rsquo;s when amateur American scientist Eunice Foote discovered what we now call the greenhouse effect. Yet we know very little about her. We don&rsquo;t even know what she looked like.</p>
