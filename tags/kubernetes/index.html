<h2>Collection Pipeline</h2>
<p class="author">By Martin Fowler

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Collection pipelines are a programming pattern where you organize some computation as a sequence of operations which compose by taking a collection as output of one operation and feeding it into the next. (Common operations are filter, map, and reduce.) This pattern is common in functional programming, and also in object-oriented languages which have lambdas. This article describes the pattern with several examples of how to form pipelines, both to introduce the pattern to those unfamiliar with it, and to help people understand the core concepts so they can more easily take ideas from one language to another.</p>

    <p>An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl tooling.</p>
<p>This post will walk through making an Operator based on an existing Helm chart to show the value you can get through an Operator, without having to write any Go code, using the Helm Operator kit from the Operator Framework. Afterwards, we are going to compare and contrast this Helm-powered Operator vs a Go-based Operator.</p>

<h2>Podman: Managing pods and containers in a local container runtime</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>People associate running pods with Kubernetes. And when they run containers in their development runtimes, they do not even think about the role pods could play&mdash;even in a localized runtime. Most people coming from the Docker world of running single containers do not envision the concept of running pods. There are several good reasons to consider using pods locally, other than using pods to naturally group your containers.</p>

    <p>Have you ever worked at a company where the same two people always got the most important projects? Me too. It's frustrating to watch these opportunities to learn from the side lines, and reliance on a small group can easily limit a company's throughput as it grows. This is so important that I've come to believe that having a wide cohort of folks who lead critical projects is one of the most important signifiers of good organizational health.</p>

<h2>Simplified – Shift Left in Software Testing</h2>
<p class="author">By Braidy Hunter

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shift Left is a buzzword in Software Testing. It is not new, in fact it has always been around. Shift left is all about creating a culture where testers can be involved early in the software development life cycle to start testing activities early. Idea is to reduce the risks.</p>

<h2>Why I Left Management: the engineering technical track vs. management track</h2>
<p class="author">By Joy Ebertz

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When advancing in an engineering career, at some point, the question will come up of if you&rsquo;re interested in the technical track or the management track. Different people thrive on different tracks and many people move back and forth between the two, some of them multiple times. While at many companies, good engineers are promoted to become engineering managers, the jobs are actually very different, and it&rsquo;s worth considering what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into and if it&rsquo;s a position in which you can thrive. As I made the transition into management and ultimately back, I learned some things about myself and how I operate.</p>

<h2>You Don’t Need To Go To College To Become a Software Engineer</h2>

    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I said it. You don&rsquo;t have to spend 4+ years and thousands of dollars to become a software developer. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s bad for you to do this. Everyone forges their own path. I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s not necessary, and here&rsquo;s why.&rdquo; </p>
