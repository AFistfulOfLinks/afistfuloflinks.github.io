<h2>API/REST testing like Chuck Norris with pytest play using YAML</h2>
<p class="author">By Davide Moro

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In this article we will see how to write HTTP API tests with pytest using YAML files thanks to pytest-play &gt;= 2.0.0 (pytest-play provides support for Selenium, MQTT, SQL and more. See third party pytest-play plugins).</p>
<p>The guest star is Chuck Norris thanks to the public JSON endpoint available at <a href="https://api.chucknorris.io/">api.chucknorris.io</a> so you will be able to run your test by your own following this example.</p>

<h2>Breaking the Test Case Addiction (Part 6)</h2>
<p class="author">By Michael Bolton

- Submitted by <a href="https://mirekdlugosz.com/" class="submitter">Miroslaw Zalewski</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the last installment, we ended by asking &ldquo;Once the tester has learned something about the product, how can you focus a tester&rsquo;s work without over-focusing it?</p>
<p>I provided some examples in Part 4 of this series. Here&rsquo;s another: scenario testing. The examples I&rsquo;ll provide here are based on work done by James Bach and Geordie Keitt several years ago. (I&rsquo;ve helped several other organizations apply this approach much more recently, but they&rsquo;re less willing to share details.)</p>
<p>The idea is to use scenarios to guide the tester to explore, experiment, and get experience with the product, acting on ideas about real-world use and about how the product might foreseeably be misused.</p>

<h2>Ctrl-Alt-Delete: The Planned Obsolescence of Old Coders</h2>
<p class="author">By A. Jesse Jiryu Davis

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Each year, 600 coders gather to talk shop at a conference in New York called PyGotham. The organizers know how male and white the tech industry is, so they make a special effort to recruit a diverse speaker lineup. They promote the event on mailing lists for women and people of color who code, and they run a workshop for women in tech to encourage them to submit talks. The organizers ask speakers to fill out a demographic survey so they can track the progress of the conference&rsquo;s diversity.</p>
<p>I serve on the conference committee, and after PyGotham ended this year, I realized I had made no effort to reach one group in particular: older coders. Compared to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in tech, the scarcity of programmers in their forties and beyond has mostly escaped notice.</p>

<h2>Developers mentoring other developers: practices I&#39;ve seen work well</h2>

<h2>From Software Engineer to Engineering Manager</h2>
<p class="author">By David Chua

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A year ago, all engineers at ShopBack reported directly to the CTO. We had no Engineering Managers (EM), no team leads, and in other words &mdash; no structure. Recognising this as a rising issue for a start-up with a 250% year-on-year growth rate, we hired a VP Engineering to put a proper structure in place.</p>
<p>Introducing engineering managers was a paradigm shift he proposed which had an outsized impact on the engineering team.</p>

<h2>How to Develop Your Talent Stack</h2>
<p class="author">By Hassan El Mghari

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>This path of being the best (top 1%) at a particular thing is an uphill battle. You’re directly competing with everyone else who wants to be the best at your skill. It requires lots of hard work, talent, and luck, and even then, it may not work out. Luckily, there is another way: Become very good at a few skills you can connect well. In other words, learn a set of complimentary skills that make you uniquely qualified.</p>

<h2>How to make your organization attractive to engineering talent</h2>
<p class="author">By Jason Swett

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Virtually everywhere I&rsquo;ve ever worked has always been desperate for good engineers. The bottleneck has never been &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have enough money to hire as many engineers as we want&rdquo;, the bottleneck is always on the supply-of-good-engineering-candidates side.</p>
<p>Good engineers of course tend to be not only employed but very well paid and well-taken-care-of in just about every way. It seems like most job ads I see these days tout unlimited PTO, catered meals, etc.&mdash;things that I never would have dreamed of when I got my first real programming job in 2005 but that are practically table stakes now.</p>
<p>In order to get a good engineer to leave his or her current well-paid and perked-to-the-max job, you have to offer that person something that&rsquo;s somehow better.</p>

<h2>On Being a Principal Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By Silvia Botros

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>One of the most common steps in defining titles when a company is hitting its growth stage is adding &lsquo;Senior&rsquo; to the moniker of engineer but soon enough, especially if retention is good and people are staying on board a number of years, companies realize they need more than just a 2 level engineering ladder. This is where titles like &lsquo;principal&rsquo; or &lsquo;staff&rsquo; engineer become part of the defined career ladder. However, principal engineer should not be seen as a natural progression to senior engineering levels.</p>

<h2>The Feedback Fallacy</h2>
<p class="author">By Marcus BuckinghamAshley Goodall

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>TThe debate about feedback at work isn&rsquo;t new. Since at least the middle of the last century, the question of how to get employees to improve has generated a good deal of opinion and research. But recently the discussion has taken on new intensity. The ongoing experiment in &ldquo;radical transparency&rdquo; at Bridgewater Associates and the culture at Netflix, which the Wall Street Journal recently described as &ldquo;encouraging harsh feedback&rdquo; and subjecting workers to &ldquo;intense and awkward&rdquo; real-time 360s, are but two examples of the overriding belief that the way to increase performance in companies is through rigorous, frequent, candid, pervasive, and often critical feedback.</p>

<h2>Unit Testing React Components</h2>
<p class="author">By Eric Elliott

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Unit testing is a great discipline which can lead to 40%-80% reductions in production bug density. Unit testing also has several other important benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves your application architecture and maintainability.</li>
<li>Leads to better APIs and composability by focusing developers on the developer experience (API) before implementation details.</li>
<li>Provides quick feedback on file-save to tell you whether or not your changes worked. This can replace console.log()and clicking around in the UI to test changes. Newcomers to unit testing might spend an extra 15% - 30% on the TDD process as they figure out how to test various components, but experienced TDD practitioners may experience savings in implementation time using TDD.</li>
<li>Provides a great safety net which can enhance your confidence when its time to add features or refactor existing features.</li>
</ul>
<p>But some things are easier to unit test than others. Specifically, unit tests work great for pure functions: Functions which given the same input, always return the same output, and have no side-effects.</p>

<h2>Why the way you accept praise at work matters</h2>
<p class="author">By Kathryn Vasel

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Almost all employees crave feedback. But when the accolades start rolling in, many get embarrassed, sink into their seat, look away or even try to negate or reject the compliment.</p>
<p>But it's important not to do that. How employees receive and acknowledge praise and positive feedback can impact work relationships and career growth.</p>
