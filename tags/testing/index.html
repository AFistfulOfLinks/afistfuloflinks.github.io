<h2>A Wall Calendar Will Change Your Life</h2>
<p class="author">By Lisa Ryan

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The act of putting pen to paper was like putting a mental sticky note in my mind; if I write something down, it&rsquo;s more likely to stick with me than if I type it into my phone. Beyond that, looking at my phone calendar has never been second nature, so during my calendar-less years, keeping up with events became more difficult. I knew about big things, work-related things, but I&rsquo;d occasionally, unintentionally, miss smaller coffee meetings or phone calls. I tried a day planner for a while, but transferring it from bag to bag just felt like a bother. &ldquo;Portable&rdquo; is overrated.</p>

<h2>All You Need to Know to Start Using Fixtures in Your pytest Code</h2>

    <p>Setting up test cases for code that manage data can be challenging but it's an important skill to reliably test your code. You might have heard of the setup and teardown methods in unittest. In pytest you use fixtures and as you will discover in this article they are actually not that hard to set up. Fixtures have been labelled pytest's killer feature so let's explore them in this article using a practical example.</p>

<h2>asyncio: We Did It Wrong</h2>
<p class="author">By Lynn Root

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We&rsquo;re led to believe that we&rsquo;re able to do a lot with the structured async/await API layer. Some tutorials, while great for the developer getting their toes wet, try to illustrate real world examples, but are actually just beefed-up &ldquo;hello, world&quot;s. Some even misuse parts of asyncio&rsquo;s interface, allowing one to easily fall into the depths of callback hell. Some get you easily up and running with asyncio, but then you may not realize it&rsquo;s not correct or exactly what you want, or only gets you part of the way there. While there are tutorials that do to improve upon the basic Hello, World &ldquo;use&rdquo; case, often times, it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. It&rsquo;s often still just a web crawler. I&rsquo;m not sure about others, but I&rsquo;m not building web crawlers at Spotify.</p>

<p>What if they want another tester to do your tests if you are not available?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your tests&rsquo;, or &lsquo;your testing&rsquo;?&rdquo;, I asked.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve heard, your tests. I don&rsquo;t agree with this but trying to see it from their point of view, said Frieda.</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if we asked them &ldquo;What happens when you want another manager to do your managing if you are not available?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;What happens when you want another programmer to do programming if the programmer is not available?&rdquo; It seems to me that the last thing they would suggest would be a set of management cases, or programming cases.

    <p>In Rapid Software Testing, we say that testing is evaluating a product by learning about it through exploration and experimentation, which includes questioning, modeling, studying, manipulating, making inferences, etc. So learning is an essential part of testing. There are lots of artifacts and people that testers could interact with to start learning about the product, which I&rsquo;ve discussed already. Let&rsquo;s look at why making a tester work through test cases might not be such a good approach.</p>

    <p>In the last installment, we ended by asking &ldquo;Once the tester has learned something about the product, how can you focus a tester&rsquo;s work without over-focusing it?</p>
<p>I provided some examples in Part 4 of this series. Here&rsquo;s another: scenario testing. The examples I&rsquo;ll provide here are based on work done by James Bach and Geordie Keitt several years ago. (I&rsquo;ve helped several other organizations apply this approach much more recently, but they&rsquo;re less willing to share details.)</p>
<p>The idea is to use scenarios to guide the tester to explore, experiment, and get experience with the product, acting on ideas about real-world use and about how the product might foreseeably be misused.</p>

<h2>Colossal Cave Adventure: Building and running 40-year-old code from the dawn of gaming</h2>

<p>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.<br>
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building<br>
and down a gully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar? If you&rsquo;re an old-school gamer, you&rsquo;ve probably seen these words hundreds of times. They&rsquo;re the starting point for Colossal Cave Adventure, the first major computer game. It was created in 1977 by Willie Crowther and Don Woods and quickly became a phenomenon in those pre-GUI, pre-Internet years. What helped the game spread from one data center to another was the fact that the source code was freely available.</p>
<p>The last version of the code from the original authors was written in 1995, and if you&rsquo;re like us, you're hearing this story and wondering where that code is now. With the encouragement and permission of the authors, open source pioneer Eric S. Raymond has ported the code to his GitLab account. In this article, we&rsquo;ll show you how to build and run that code.</p>

    <p>With continuous integration and deployment built around our platforms, we have to change the way we look at testing so we can address the increasing need for more automation and faster delivery of high quality products and solutions.

<h2>Demystifying @decorators in Python</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Decorators are one of the most powerful tools Python has, but it may seem elusive to beginners. My first introduction to decorators was through Flask, the web framework. I didn&rsquo;t really delve into it at that time, just accepted it as a part of the Flask framework that I was to use mindlessly. Maybe it was that way for you too, but you&rsquo;re here&mdash;that means you want to change that. So let&rsquo;s do it!</p>

    <p>Most websites these days are Single Page Applications (SPA for short) where a single entry file handles all routes that a user might visit. Swept up in the ongoing trend of hosting in the cloud you might find yourself needing to &ldquo;dockerize&rdquo; your SPA. That is to say wrap it inside a Docker image and run it as a container. In this post we will explore how we can get that done.</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Loops of exploration, experimentation, studying, modeling, and learning are the essence of testing, not an add-on to it. The intersection of activity and models (such as the Heuristic Test Strategy Model) help us to perform testing while continuously developing, refining, and reviewing it. Testing is much more than writing a bunch of automated checks to confirm that the product can do something; it&rsquo;s an ongoing investigation in which we continuously develop our understanding of the product.</p>

<h2>Fiction: The science in Sherlock Holmes</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>When Sherlock Holmes first meets Dr John Watson, he identifies the physician's background at a glance. To many, that moment in Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet (1887) &mdash; Holmes's debut &mdash; is a smile-worthy flight of fancy. Except it isn't entirely fantastical. One of Conan Doyle's mentors at the University of Edinburgh, UK, where he trained as an ophthalmologist, was the surgeon Joseph Bell. And it's to him that we owe the famed exchange about Afghanistan, as well as much of Holmes's character.</p>

<h2>Fix by symptoms, fix by causes</h2>

They can, and should, work on setting the relationship right so that instead of fixing by symptoms, we fix by causes.</p>

    <p>We're several months into the work at the firm, and one very interesting concept has come to the fore: The implementation of preemptive change is about desire. Or, as one senior leader proffered at a recent executive steering committee meeting, &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it.&quot; I love this statement: &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it!&quot; It's a straightforward way to summarize an otherwise elegant management philosophy -- one that connotes desire, focus, and a commitment to change. In the interest of furthering this theory, let me propose five basic leadership principles we can use to form the backbone of the &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it&quot; philosophy. </p>

    <p>When you&rsquo;re recruiting in a tight talent market, the goal isn&rsquo;t to have every candidate choose you over competitors. A candidate might be a poor match for your company but a great fit for a competitor.</p>
<p>Instead, handle the competition by highlighting your employer&rsquo;s brand, showing candidates what it&rsquo;s like to work at your company. Leave it to the candidate to decide what they want and determine if your company is the right fit. This will filter out the candidates who wouldn&rsquo;t be happy in the role, and will allow you to hire the person who genuinely wants to work at your company.</p>

   In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.</p>
<p><br>
You can say that EDA is statisticians way of story telling where you explore data, find patterns and tells insights. Often you have some questions in hand you try to validate those questions by performing EDA.</p>

<h2>Let’s Not Kill Performance Evaluations Yet</h2>
<p class="author">By Lori GolerJanelle GaleAdam Grant

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The long march to the boss&rsquo;s office to get evaluated&mdash;it&rsquo;s a moment we all dread. Performance reviews are awkward. They&rsquo;re biased. They stick us in boxes and leave us waiting far too long for feedback. It&rsquo;s no surprise that by the end of 2015, at least 30 of the Fortune 500 companies had ditched performance evaluations altogether. But let&rsquo;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

<h2>Monkeypatching with pytest</h2>
<p class="author">By Patrick Kennedy

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Monkeypatching is dynamically changing a piece of software (such as a module, object, method, or function) at runtime. Monkeypatching is often used for bug fixes or prototyping software, especially when using external APIs or libraries. Pytest uses this feature to allow you to test out interfaces that you don&rsquo;t want to actually execute. For example, you can create a monkeypatched version of the requests module that doesn&rsquo;t do the actual HTTP transactions during testing, but just returns fixed data that you set.</p>

<h2>On Being a Principal Engineer</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>One of the most common steps in defining titles when a company is hitting its growth stage is adding &lsquo;Senior&rsquo; to the moniker of engineer but soon enough, especially if retention is good and people are staying on board a number of years, companies realize they need more than just a 2 level engineering ladder. This is where titles like &lsquo;principal&rsquo; or &lsquo;staff&rsquo; engineer become part of the defined career ladder. However, principal engineer should not be seen as a natural progression to senior engineering levels.</p>

    <p>A good software architecture allows decisions about frameworks, databases, web-servers, and other environmental issues and tools, to be deferred and delayed. A good architecture makes it unnecessary to decide on Rails, or Spring, or Hibernate, or Tomcat or MySql, until much later in the project. A good architecture makes it easy to change your mind about those decisions too. A good architecture emphasizes the use-cases and decouples them from peripheral concerns. </p>

    <p>Next to making sure that your code works now, it&rsquo;s also important to make sure that developers are able to fix defects in the future. The first step to achieving this is to write tests. Preferably, you are writing the tests before you write the code. But even if you have done that your tests might still be inaccessible to other developers or make it hard for them to figure out what broke.

    <p>&ldquo;There are many different types of testing that you can use to make sure that changes to your code are working as expected. Not all testing is equal, though, and we will see here how the main testing practices differ from each other.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>The Good, The Bad and The Beautiful of Employee Empowerment</h2>
<p class="author">By Ritz Carlton Leadership Center

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We&rsquo;re often asked: &ldquo;Can employees at The Ritz-Carlton really spend $2,000 per day per guest?&rdquo; The answer is, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; At The Ritz-Carlton, everyone has $2,000/day per guest to make it right or delight, but the money is symbolic. No one is walking around with $2,000 in his or her pocket. However, from day one at your job, you&rsquo;re encouraged and empowered to fix or improve a guest&rsquo;s experience, and you may spend up to $2,000 to do this.</p>

<h2>The Invention of Zero: How Ancient Mesopotamia Created the Mathematical Concept of Nought and Ancient India Gave It Symbolic Form</h2>

    <p>Central to humanity&rsquo;s quest to grasp the nature of the universe and make sense of our own existence is zero, which began in Mesopotamia and spurred one of the most significant paradigm shifts in human consciousness &mdash; a concept first invented (or perhaps discovered) in pre-Arab Sumer, modern-day Iraq, and later given symbolic form in ancient India.</p>

<h2>The Shift-Left Approach to Software Testing</h2>
<p class="author">By Arthur Hicken

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The earlier you find out about problems in your code, the less impact they have and the less it costs to remediate them. Therefore, it's helpful to move testing activities earlier in the software development lifecycle&mdash;shifting it left in the process timeline. This article explores the shift-left methodology and how you can approach shifting left in your organization.</p>

<h2>The state of Python Packaging</h2>
<p class="author">By Bernat Gabor

- Submitted by Elijah DeLee

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>pip 19.0 has been released on 22nd January 2019. On the feature list most notably it now supports PEP-517, which by default is turned on when that the project has a pyproject.toml at the root folder. The PEP in question has been created in 2015 and accepted in 2017. Even though it took a while until pip implemented it, the release and the issues that followed it up confirmed that many people are not at all familiar with it. Read on if you want to get a picture of how the Python packaging ecosystem evolved as of today and where we hope to see it down the line. We hope even though the introduction of aforementioned python enhancement proposal may cause some discomfort at the moment, we will benefit from it in the long term.</p>

    <p>My career has meandered its way not into the biological or physical sciences, but into something we&rsquo;re currently calling site reliability engineering &ndash; a strange amalgam of systems administration, performance management, software development, quality control, and the crafting of antifragility, a practice I don&rsquo;t really know what to call other than &ldquo;applied statistics&rdquo;. In the narrowest view, SRE can be limited to a fancier name for release management, but in most organizations there is runway to make it much more.</p>

<h2>What Mentors Wish Their Mentees Knew</h2>

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The mentor-mentee relationship is a tango between a more senior person and a junior one. Just as in dance, coordination and orchestration between parties is necessary for grace and success. And while we and others have written about what makes the ideal mentor, comparatively less attention has been given to the other partner. This gap is unfortunate because, like mentorship, menteeship requires specific behaviors &mdash; without which the mentee&rsquo;s success may be threatened. In this article, we outline six habits of ideal mentees and provide anecdotes and views from our combined years of academic experience. While we focus on the relationship in academic medicine, the takeaways apply to most any field.&rdquo; </p>
