<h2>An awesome new Python profiler: py-spy!</h2>
<p class="author">By Julia Evans

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The other day I learned that Ben Frederickson has written an awesome new Python profiler called py-spy!</p>
<p>It takes a similar approach to profiling as rbspy, the profiler I worked on earlier this year &ndash; it can profile any running Python program, it uses process_vm_readv to read memory, and it by default displays profiling information in a really easy-to-use way.</p>

<h2>Attracting people to work for you</h2>
<p class="author">By James Stainer

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>As a manager, hiring is something that you&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of. It sometimes can feel like a drag, especially when the interviews aren&rsquo;t yielding any result. However, getting the right people into the company is essential from both a technical perspective and a cultural perspective, so it deserves your careful attention and time. After all, since you are being judged by the output you delegate through your team, you need to make sure your team has top-notch people.</p>

<h2>Can Reading Make You Happier?</h2>
<p class="author">By Ceridwen Dovey

<blockquote>
    <p>Several years ago, I was given as a gift a remote session with a bibliotherapist at the London headquarters of the School of Life, which offers innovative courses to help people deal with the daily emotional challenges of existence. I have to admit that at first I didn&rsquo;t really like the idea of being given a reading &ldquo;prescription.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>How I read books: setting up a new system</h2>
<p class="author">By Denys Zhadanov

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Instead of reading 100 books, it’s better to find one that really changes your life. That’s why I made the decision to be very particular about which books I’m reading, but once I pick one, I want to learn as much as possible from it.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis in Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Adnan Siddiqi

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>According to Wikipedia:<br>
   In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.</p>
<p><br>
You can say that EDA is statisticians way of story telling where you explore data, find patterns and tells insights. Often you have some questions in hand you try to validate those questions by performing EDA.</p>

<h2>Let’s Not Kill Performance Evaluations Yet</h2>
<p class="author">By Lori GolerJanelle GaleAdam Grant

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The long march to the boss&rsquo;s office to get evaluated&mdash;it&rsquo;s a moment we all dread. Performance reviews are awkward. They&rsquo;re biased. They stick us in boxes and leave us waiting far too long for feedback. It&rsquo;s no surprise that by the end of 2015, at least 30 of the Fortune 500 companies had ditched performance evaluations altogether. But let&rsquo;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

<h2>The Complete Guide to Effective Reading</h2>
<p class="author">By Maarten van Doorn

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Learning is a heavily misunderstood concept.</p>
<p>As a paradigm example of deep work, we understand that, when reading, directing your full attention to the material at hand is essential. Grasping complex information is hard.</p>
<p>But this is only half the battle.</p>
<p>After some string of words hits your retina and made its way to your brain, you&rsquo;re not done.</p>
<p>In a cruel irony, these hours of deep work often cause flow states and the feeling that &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve had a good day&rsquo; and learned a shitload of new stuff.</p>
<p>But for many reading episodes this feeling is deceptive. There is an ineliminable aspect to learning that takes place after the glorious flow state.</p>
<p>The other half of the battle is to transfer the newly acquired intelligence from your working memory to your long-term understanding and integrate it into your standing stack of mental models.</p>

<h2>Why individual OKRs don’t work for us</h2>
<p class="author">By Johanna Bolin Tingvall

- Submitted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cswiii" class="submitter">Corey Welton</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>OKRs work well on a corporate level, they are great for visualizing common objectives and outcomes and getting everyone moving in the same direction. But our corporate level is very nimble, it has to be. So our objectives change fast and adapting iterated OKRs on multiple levels all the way to the individual consumed time and energy that we just couldn&rsquo;t afford that often.</p>
