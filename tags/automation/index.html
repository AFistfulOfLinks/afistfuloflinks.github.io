<h2>[DeeperDebug] - Freeze FF60! You&#39;re under Exception!</h2>
<p class="author">By Pete Savage

    <p>Sometimes I hate the depths I'm willing to sink to in order to debug an issue. Sometimes I love it. I've not made my mind up which one it is for this issue yet, hopefully you'll see why at the end.  </p>

<h2>Automation is not automagic: Why better software automation matters</h2>

<h2>Fiction: The science in Sherlock Holmes</h2>
<p class="author">By Maria Konnikova

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When Sherlock Holmes first meets Dr John Watson, he identifies the physician's background at a glance. To many, that moment in Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet (1887) &mdash; Holmes's debut &mdash; is a smile-worthy flight of fancy. Except it isn't entirely fantastical. One of Conan Doyle's mentors at the University of Edinburgh, UK, where he trained as an ophthalmologist, was the surgeon Joseph Bell. And it's to him that we owe the famed exchange about Afghanistan, as well as much of Holmes's character.</p>

<h2>On Being a Senior Engineer</h2>
<p class="author">By John Allspaw

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>What does it actually mean to be &lsquo;senior&rsquo; in this discipline? I certainly have an opinion of what it means, given that I&rsquo;m charged with hiring, supporting, and retaining engineers whom are deemed to be senior. This notion that there is a bar to be passed in terms of career development is a good one, but I&rsquo;d also add that these criteria exist on a spectrum, as opposed to a simple list of check-boxes. You don&rsquo;t wake up one day and you are &ldquo;senior&rdquo; just because your title reflects that upon a promotion. Senior engineers don&rsquo;t know everything. They&rsquo;re not perfect in their technical knowledge, and they&rsquo;re OK with that.</p>

<h2>Tests that sometimes fail</h2>
<p class="author">By Sam Saffron

- Submitted by Peter Ondrejka

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Once you have a project that is a few years old with a large test suite an ugly pattern emerges.</p>
<p>Some tests that used to always work, start &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo; working. This starts slowly, &ldquo;oh that test, yeah it sometimes fails, kick the build off again&rdquo;. If left unmitigated it can very quickly snowball and paralyze an entire test suite.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>What are the benefits of automation?</h2>
<p class="author">By Viktor Slavchev

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>What is the true purpose of automation? To help that, let’s look at some forms of automation that we take for granted – the car, the washing machine, the airplane. If they were simply “automating tedious manual actions” we would currently have carriage with robotic horses or robot performing human washing of clothes or flying machine that’s flapping its wings. Anyway, none of this is the case. Instead – a smarter, more creative, more efficient technological approach is used so that we can get the same result.</p>
