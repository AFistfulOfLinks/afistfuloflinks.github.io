<h2>Another Side of-- Scott Fitzgerald?</h2>
<p class="author">By Sally Koslow

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Do you remember your first F. Scott Fitzgerald? How you realized there was something more to literature, a voice, a time, a glamor? And then you heard about Zelda, and the Jazz Age, and Gatsby, and the beautiful shirts? And thought about why Nick Carraway was named that, and what Scott&rsquo;s life was really like, and whether it would have been amazing or tragic?<br>
Sally Koslow explored, absorbed, researched and recreated&mdash;and brings us&mdash;lucky us&mdash;a wonderful narrative biography into one part of Scott Fitzgerald&rsquo;s life.</p>

<h2>Functional Programming in Scala Specialization</h2>
<p class="author">By Coursera

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. You'll see how the functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large; from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark. A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.</p>

<h2>On Solving Bigger Problems in Life</h2>
<p class="author">By Chris Castiglione

    <p>Last month, while reading Harvard Business Review&rsquo;s book On Strategy, I came across the concept of a Big Hairy Audacious Goal - often shorthanded as BHAG - which refers to life-goals that are beyond the limits of what seems possible.</p>

<h2>Rating the Severity of Usability Problems</h2>
<p class="author">By Jeff Sauro

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>If only one out of 1000 users encounters a problem with a website, then it&rsquo;s a minor problem.</p>
<p>If that sentence bothered you, it should.</p>
<p>It could be that that single problem resulted in one visitor&rsquo;s financial information inadvertently being posted to the website for the world to see.</p>
<p>Or it could be a slight hesitation with a label on an obscure part of a website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the responsibility of user experience professionals to help developers make decisions about what to fix.</p>
<p>Accounting for problem frequency and severity are two critical ingredients when communicating the importance of usability problems.</p>

<h2>Taming Irreversibility with Feature Flags (in Python)</h2>
<p class="author">By Hugo Bessa

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Feature Flags are a very simple technique to make features of your application quickly toggleable. The way it works is, everytime we change some behavior in our software, a logical branch is created and this new behavior is only accessible if some specific configuration variable is set or, in certain cases, if the application context respects some rules.</p>
