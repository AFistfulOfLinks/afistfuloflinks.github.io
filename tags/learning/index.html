    <p>I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.</p>
<p>Why is knowing how to learn so important? The answer is simple: as languages evolve, libraries are created, and tools are upgraded. Knowing how to learn will be essential to keeping up with these changes and becoming a successful programmer.</p>
<p>In this article, we will offer several learning strategies that will help jump start your journey of becoming a rockstar Python programmer!</p>

<h2>Change management will make or break key technology rollouts</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;IT organizations are getting better at change management, but there are still many that &ldquo;throw projects over the fence&rdquo; and expect adoption. In some cases, senior business partners accept or even promote this approach. Your enterprise may achieve some success with informal change management, but you&rsquo;ll never realize a project&rsquo;s full business value unless you have buy-in and engagement from the ultimate users. That requires change management.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>The Complete Guide to Effective Reading</h2>
<p class="author">By Maarten van Doorn

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Learning is a heavily misunderstood concept.</p>
<p>As a paradigm example of deep work, we understand that, when reading, directing your full attention to the material at hand is essential. Grasping complex information is hard.</p>
<p>But this is only half the battle.</p>
<p>After some string of words hits your retina and made its way to your brain, you&rsquo;re not done.</p>
<p>In a cruel irony, these hours of deep work often cause flow states and the feeling that &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve had a good day&rsquo; and learned a shitload of new stuff.</p>
<p>But for many reading episodes this feeling is deceptive. There is an ineliminable aspect to learning that takes place after the glorious flow state.</p>
<p>The other half of the battle is to transfer the newly acquired intelligence from your working memory to your long-term understanding and integrate it into your standing stack of mental models.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I like to use Makefiles. I like to use Makefiles in Java. I like to use Makefiles in Erlang. I like to use Makefiles in Elixir. And most recently, I like to use Makefiles in Ruby. I think you, too, would like to use Makefiles in your environment, and the engineering community would benefit if more of us used Makefiles, in general.&rdquo; </p>

    <p>&ldquo;When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student once told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only what he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the only time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>The Value in Go&#39;s Simplicity</h2>
<p class="author">By Benjamin Congdon

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;As the Go community celebrated its 10th birthday I was thinking about what makes Go unique. I think a lot of the real power of Go has come from the philosophy of its designers: There&rsquo;s a strong emphasis on forward compatibility, the language doesn&rsquo;t have flashy features that hurt readability, and it comes out-of-the-box with everything you truly need (a basic test library, solid networking and synchronization primitives, and templating, to name a few).&rdquo; </p>

<h2>There is no Agile Quality Engineering</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>The main takeaway of this article is to show you that if you are thinking of starting Agile in QE, you miss the point. It is essential to create unified and cross-functional teams to get the real value from an Agile workflow.</p>

<h2>Why individual OKRs don’t work for us</h2>
<p class="author">By Johanna Bolin Tingvall

- Submitted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cswiii" class="submitter">Corey Welton</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>OKRs work well on a corporate level, they are great for visualizing common objectives and outcomes and getting everyone moving in the same direction. But our corporate level is very nimble, it has to be. So our objectives change fast and adapting iterated OKRs on multiple levels all the way to the individual consumed time and energy that we just couldn&rsquo;t afford that often.</p>

<h2>Yes! and... How to be effective in the theatre of work</h2>
<p class="author">By Tom Critchlow

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;I recently read the book Impro - Improvisation and the Theatre by Keith Johnstone. I loved the book and as Venkatesh said &lsquo;it is a textbook that teaches you how to see the world differently.&rsquo; so consider it recommended. . It&rsquo;s a delightful book all about improvisational theatre and importantly how to teach improvisational theatre. The book inspired me to draw many analogies between the improv actor and the consultant&rdquo; </p>
