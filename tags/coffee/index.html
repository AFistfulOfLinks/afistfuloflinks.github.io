<blockquote>
    <p>Before exploring machine learning methods for time series, it is a good idea to ensure you have exhausted classical linear time series forecasting methods. Classical time series forecasting methods may be focused on linear relationships, nevertheless, they are sophisticated and perform well on a wide range of problems, assuming that your data is suitably prepared and the method is well configured.</p>
<p>In this post, will you will discover a suite of classical methods for time series forecasting that you can test on your forecasting problem prior to exploring to machine learning methods.</p>

<h2>13 Things Mentally Strong People Won&#39;t Do</h2>
<p class="author">By Dr. Travis Bradberry

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We all reach critical points in our lives where our mental strength is tested. It might be a toxic friend or colleague, a dead-end job, or a struggling relationship. Whatever the challenge, you have to see things through a new lens, and take decisive action if you want to move through it successfully.</p>
<p>It sounds easy, but it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating how mentally strong people set themselves apart from the crowd. Where others see impenetrable barriers, they see challenges to overcome.</p>

<h2>In Defense of YAML</h2>
<p class="author">By Rod Johnson

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I'm not against YAML, just against abuse of YAML. I want to help prevent people abusing YAML and being cruel to themselves and their coworkers in the process.</p>
<p>YAML's strength is as a structured data format. Yes, it has issues. Whitespace is a minefield. Its syntax is surprisingly complex. It has gotchas: &quot;Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway.&quot; But YAML is human readable and supports comments: two key benefits that drive its popularity.</p>
<p>Where it can go wrong is where we use YAML to describe behavior.</p>

<h2>Linux now dominates Azure</h2>
<p class="author">By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Three years ago, Mark Russinovich, CTO ofAzure, Microsoft's cloud program, said, &quot;One in four [Azure] instances are Linux.&quot; Then, in 2017, it was 40 percent Azure virtual machines (VM) were Linux. Today, Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise group, said in an interview, &quot;it's about half now, but it varies on the day because a lot of these workloads are elastic, but sometimes slightly over half of Azure VMs are Linux.&quot; Microsoft later clarified, &quot;about half Azure VMs are Linux.</p>

<h2>My Unexpected Journey to Becoming a Software Tester (From Entry-level to a Manager)</h2>
<p class="author">By Mahesh C.

- Submitted by Jake Callahan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>My journey as a Software Tester started a bit unexpectedly.</p>
<p>I appeared for the initial interview rounds assuming it to be a Development opportunity. To be honest, like every other Computer Science graduate out there, I was a bit skeptical about going ahead with Testing.</p>
<p>But finally, I decided to give it a try. Only with a hope that my curious nature will help me in this field.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t accept the offer without putting up this question &ndash; Will I get an opportunity to switch to Development in case Testing doesn&rsquo;t interest me?</p>

<h2>The history of cold-brew coffee is fascinating. (An 1840s Algerian fortress is involved.)</h2>
<p class="author">By Matt Reimann

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In Cuba,&rdquo; reports a coffee compendium published in 1922, &ldquo;the custom is to grind the coffee fine, to put it into a receiving vessel, and to pour cold water on it. This is repeated many times, until the coffee mass is well saturated. The final result is a highly concentrated extract, which serves for making cafe au lait, or cafe noir, as desired.&rdquo; What this century-old recipe describes, of course, is nothing less than the trendiest drink of the past several summers: cold-brew coffee.</p>
