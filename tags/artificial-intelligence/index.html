<h2>11 Beginner Tips for Learning Python Programming</h2>
<p class="author">By Krishelle Hardson-Hurley

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.</p>
<p>Why is knowing how to learn so important? The answer is simple: as languages evolve, libraries are created, and tools are upgraded. Knowing how to learn will be essential to keeping up with these changes and becoming a successful programmer.</p>
<p>In this article, we will offer several learning strategies that will help jump start your journey of becoming a rockstar Python programmer!</p>

<h2>From Behaviorist to Constructivist AI</h2>
<p class="author">By Aaron Schumacher

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>B. F. Skinner might be satisfied that neural networks achieve intelligence when they perform tasks well. This behaviorist perspective leads to misunderstandings of current technology and limits development toward systems that think. (...) In general, a constructivist approach will become necessary for advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Kite Launches AI-Powered JavaScript Completions — Code Faster with Kite</h2>
<p class="author">By The Kite Team -

- Submitted by Twinkle Pardeshi

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The JavaScript ecosystem continually invents new frameworks and design patterns. These inventions make it a vibrant place to be, but it also creates the need to learn an ever-changing set of code patterns and APIs. Kite&rsquo;s deep learning models have learned all of these patterns, understand the context of your code, so Kite can predict chunks of code and put them in your completions.</p>

<h2>Learn New Technology as a Way of Stepping Up Your Understanding of Your Current One</h2>
<p class="author">By Ben Halpern

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>One common question for software developers is how to progress from 'intermediate' to 'senior'&mdash;whatever those titles mean. A lot of the journey is how you position yourself and stay confident, but in terms of taking these leaps in your own capacity as a technologist, I have a thought on the subject.</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance for Artificial Intelligence (three-part series)</h2>

    <p>So you give your data to a guy who calls him/herself a data scientist and ask them to create something for predicting the demand &mdash; the data scientist calls this the &ldquo;model&rdquo;.

<h2>Your Professional Growth Questionnaire</h2>

    <p>For many of the companies I&rsquo;ve worked at for the past three decades, performance season is three weeks once a year. More progressive companies have a major performance cycle per year with a minor one six months after the major to capture one-off promotions for exceptional, errors in job leveling at hiring, and other performance housekeeping tasks that can&rsquo;t wait another six months.</p>
