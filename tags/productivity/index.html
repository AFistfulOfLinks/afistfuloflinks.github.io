<h2>6 Steps Leaders Can Take to Get the Most Out of Feedback</h2>
<p class="author">By Jennifer Porter

- Submitted by Karel Piwko

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Business publications are filled with articles about feedback: how important it is for leaders, how leaders can both give and receive it, what happens when leaders don&rsquo;t get it, and even what to do if someone is not open to feedback they have been given. The focus tends to be on the transfer of data.</p>
<p>What is less explored is how leaders should respond once they receive that data. Through our work coaching thousands of leaders across industries, my colleagues and I have found that, even when leaders make an effort to collect robust feedback, they only access about 25% of its potential value.</p>

<h2>7 Things You Need To Stop Doing To Be More Productive, Backed By Science</h2>
<p class="author">By CamMi Pham

- Submitted by Kedar Vijay Kulkarni

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When I was 17 years old, I used to work and study for about 20 hours a day. I went to school, did my homework during breaks and managed a not-for-profit organization at night. At that time, working long hours landed me countless national campaigns, opportunities to work with A-list organizations and a successful career. As I got older, I started to think differently. I realized that working more is not always the right, or only, path to success.</p>

<h2>Can Engineering Productivity Be Measured?</h2>
<p class="author">By Charity

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The right way to look at performance is at the team level. Individual engineers don’t own or maintain code; teams do. The team is the irreducible unit of ownership. So you need to incentivize people to think about work and spending their time cooperatively, optimizing for what is best for the team.</p>

<h2>Career narratives</h2>
<p class="author">By Will Larson

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A peculiar challenge of management is trying to invest in someone's career development when they themselves are uncertain about their goals. As a manager, you may have more experience and more access to opportunities within the company, but that represents a small slice of someone's career possibilities. Our schooling often rewards us for being methodical, linear thinkers, but that approach is less effective outside the intentionally constrained possibility spaces.</p>

<h2>Google asked 5,600 employees about remote work. This is what they learned</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>On the outset of the study, the team hypothesized that distributed teams might not be as productive as their centrally located counterparts. &ldquo;We were a little nervous about that,&rdquo; says Gilrane. She was surprised to find that distributed teams performed just as well. Unfortunately, she also found that there is a lot more frustration involved in working remotely. Workers in other offices can sometimes feel burdened to sync up their schedules with the main office. They can also feel disconnected from the team.</p>

    <p>Like many of you out there, I have a long list of cool hobby project ideas that I never actually start because of, you know, more important things (day job, life, parties on the weekend, etc). Well, this changed recently for some reason, and by the end of this summer, my list finally got shorter by one. While I was working on this project, I made lots of notes for myself. Reading back over them, I’ve realized that the biggest roadblocks were not coding-related. They were more like mental roadblocks.</p>

<h2>Why you should stop using Git rebase</h2>
<p class="author">By Fredrik V. Mørken

<blockquote>
    <p>After using Git for several years, I found myself gradually using more and more advanced Git commands as part of my daily workflow. Soon after I discovered Git rebase, I quickly incorporated it into my daily workflow. Those who are familiar with rebasing know how powerful a tool it is, and how tempting it is to use it all the time. However, I soon discovered that rebasing presents some challenges that are not obvious when you first start doing it. Before presenting them, I&rsquo;ll quickly recap the differences between merging and rebasing.</p>

<h2>Your favorite writers, ranked by height</h2>

    <p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to write this list. I wasn&rsquo;t going to, but then I mentioned it, half-joking, in the Literary Hub office. Turns out everyone was extremely excited about finding out how tall their favorite writers were (or are). Who knew, right? Anyway, I decided to do it after all. Because it is fun. If you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fun, well, I don&rsquo;t have to explain my art to you.</p>

<h2>Your Productivity Hinges on How You Arrange Your Desk</h2>
<p class="author">By Alli Hoff Kosik

- Submitted by Daniel Gur

<blockquote>
    <p>If your job requires you to sit at a desk, you probably spend more waking hours at that desk each day than you do in your own home (or in any other part of your home, if that&rsquo;s where you work from). If you love your job, this may not seem like such a bad thing, but it&rsquo;s still worth maximizing your small space for ultimate productivity.<br>
We asked design and productivity experts for advice on how best to structure, organize, and decorate your desk to create a workspace that serves you, keeps you on task, and makes you feel good about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
