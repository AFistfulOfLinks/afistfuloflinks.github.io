<blockquote>
    <p>Before exploring machine learning methods for time series, it is a good idea to ensure you have exhausted classical linear time series forecasting methods. Classical time series forecasting methods may be focused on linear relationships, nevertheless, they are sophisticated and perform well on a wide range of problems, assuming that your data is suitably prepared and the method is well configured.</p>
<p>In this post, will you will discover a suite of classical methods for time series forecasting that you can test on your forecasting problem prior to exploring to machine learning methods.</p>

    <p>A First Team mindset is the idea that leaders prioritize supporting their fellow leaders over supporting their direct reports&mdash;that they are responsible to their peers more than they are to their individual teams.

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The typical approach to self-improvement is to set a large goal, then try to take big leaps in order to accomplish the goal in as little time as possible. While this may sound good in theory, it often ends in burnout, frustration, and failure. Instead, we should focus on continuous improvement by slowly and slightly adjusting our normal everyday habits and behaviors.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Extracting Super Mario Bros levels with Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Matthew Earl

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For an upcoming project, I need to extract level data from the classic 1985 video game Super Mario Bros (SMB). More precisely, I want to extract the background imagery for each stage of the game, excluding HUD elements and moving sprites, etc. Of course, I could just stitch together images from the game, and perhaps automate this process with computer vision techniques. But I think the method described below is more interesting, and allows for inspection of elements of the level perhaps not exposed through screenshots. </p>

<h2>Linux now dominates Azure</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Three years ago, Mark Russinovich, CTO ofAzure, Microsoft's cloud program, said, &quot;One in four [Azure] instances are Linux.&quot; Then, in 2017, it was 40 percent Azure virtual machines (VM) were Linux. Today, Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise group, said in an interview, &quot;it's about half now, but it varies on the day because a lot of these workloads are elastic, but sometimes slightly over half of Azure VMs are Linux.&quot; Microsoft later clarified, &quot;about half Azure VMs are Linux.</p>

<h2>Make. It. Simple. Linux Desktop Usability</h2>
<p class="author">By probono

<blockquote>
    <p>Why do desktop environments increasingly degrade the desktop UX that once used to be straightforward and &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;? Is there a secret plan to cripple the desktop experience by infecting it with less suitable UX concepts invented for mobile phones? In this series, I will look at recent worrisome trends in desktop Linux usability and contrast them with the thoughts of the very inventors of the desktop metaphor as we know it. </p>

<h2>The Singleton Pattern</h2>
<p class="author">By Brandon Rhodes

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Python programmers almost never implement the Singleton Pattern as described in the Gang of Four book, whose Singleton class forbids normal instantiation and instead offers a class method that returns the singleton instance. Python is more elegant, and lets a class continue to support the normal syntax for instantiation while defining a custom __new__() method that returns the singleton instance. But an even more Pythonic approach, if your design forces you to offer global access to a singleton object, is to use The Global Object Pattern instead.&rdquo; </p>
