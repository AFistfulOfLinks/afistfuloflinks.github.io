<h2>Cognitive bias cheat sheet</h2>
<p class="author">By Buster Benson

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Every cognitive bias is there for a reason — primarily to save our brains time or energy. If you look at them by the problem they’re trying to solve, it becomes a lot easier to understand why they exist, how they’re useful, and the trade-offs (and resulting mental errors) that they introduce.</p>

<h2>Documentation as a way to build Community</h2>
<p class="author">By Melissa Mendonça

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>It is clear that for an open-source software project, documentation is the public face of the project. The docs influence how people interact with the software and with the community. It sets the tone about inclusiveness, how people communicate and what users and contributors can do. (...) So, if everybody agrees on its importance, why is it so hard to write good documentation? </p>

<h2>Kite Launches AI-Powered JavaScript Completions — Code Faster with Kite</h2>
<p class="author">By The Kite Team -

- Submitted by Twinkle Pardeshi

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The JavaScript ecosystem continually invents new frameworks and design patterns. These inventions make it a vibrant place to be, but it also creates the need to learn an ever-changing set of code patterns and APIs. Kite&rsquo;s deep learning models have learned all of these patterns, understand the context of your code, so Kite can predict chunks of code and put them in your completions.</p>

<h2>Marc Andreessen</h2>
<p class="author">By Sriram Krishan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Marc is one of the most notable and influential figures in the history of the internet. We were lucky to have a wide ranging conversation with him on how he spends his time, how he tries to set goals for himself, how he reads so much, what keeps him so plugged in after all of these years and what he wants people to build.</p>

<h2>Seek the Challengers</h2>
<p class="author">By Shripriya Mahesh

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>People like that&mdash;I call them challengers&mdash;can often be the smartest people in the room. They question because they want to understand the logic and thinking behind ingrained cultural habits. They want to use their time well, and they want to make a big impact.</p>

<h2>Seven Kinds of Testers</h2>
<p class="author">By James Bach

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most of my work is teaching, coaching, and evaluating testers. But as a humanist, I want to apply the Diversity Heuristic: <em>our differences can make us a stronger team</em>. That means I can&rsquo;t pick one comfortable kind of tester and grade people against that template. On the other hand, I do see interesting patterns of skill and temperament among testers, and it seems reasonable to talk about those patterns in a broad sense.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most of us understand the advantages of automation in testing: Automation helps you run the checks faster, multiple times, and for a long time. However, while automation can help you save time and money, there are a few hidden costs that many miss.</p>
