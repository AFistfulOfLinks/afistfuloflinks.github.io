<h2>How To Get Buy–In From Management</h2>
<p class="author">By Lisa Crispin

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Development managers as well as executives often don&rsquo;t really understand quality or why the company should make a big investment in it. Everyone says they want the best quality (...) How do we get the people whose support we need to make real changes on board with those changes?</p>

<h2>How to mock in Python? – (almost) definitive guide</h2>
<p class="author">By Sebastian Buczyński

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Mock is a category of so-called <em>test doubles</em> &ndash; objects that mimic the behaviour of other objects. They are meant to be used in tests to replace real implementation that for some reason cannot be used (e.g. because they cause side effects, like transferring funds or launching nukes). Mocks are used to write assertions about the way they are used &ndash; e.g. if they were called, which arguments were used etc.</p>

<h2>Sota so Good</h2>
<p class="author">By James Thomas

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Koen observes that, while the scientific method has been much studied, he does not believe that engineering is simply &quot;applied science&quot; and there is little literature on what he calls the <em>engineering method</em>. (...) As Koen develops his ideas on what the engineering method could be, he co-opts a term, <em>state of the art</em> (abbreviated as <em>sota</em>), which he takes to be the set of heuristics known by an individual or a group at a specific time.</p>

<h2>The Scout Rule on Tickets</h2>
<p class="author">By Maaret Pyhäjärvi

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For a long time, I have been particularly fascinated with the tickets of bugs, issues, and work that we log on tools like Jira. I've been looking into them in more detail, realizing that they can sometimes be helpful, but more often they are a liability: an excuse to not deal with things, a way to externalize ideas with a significant cost and something any tester is so routinely trained to pay attention to that the change in this requires a whole rewiring of how we deal with things in teams.</p>

<h2>Your Employees Are Not Your Friends</h2>
<p class="author">By Lacy Starling - Contributed Frank Jansen

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>About five years into owning my business, I was eviscerated by a 360-degree evaluation my employees gave me. They accused me of favoritism &mdash; of liking some employees more than others, of giving those employees more leeway in their work, and of ignoring the people I wasn&rsquo;t close to at work. They were right.</p>
