<h2>5 Ways to Optimize Tests for Continuous Integration</h2>
<p class="author">By John Ruberto

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many teams have existing automated test suites that are not included in a continuous integration program. Maybe the tests take too long to execute, or they are not reliable enough to give accurate results. Here&rsquo;s how to assess your test suites in terms of value added and time to execute, along with five proven strategies to optimize those suites for CI.</p>

<h2>Empowerment can be tricky!</h2>
<p class="author">By Jeremy West

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Within the past several weeks I've had the opportunity to mentor and be mentored on the topic of empowering your team while maintaining respect for RACI rules. When I look back at in my career at the times I felt most inspired by my leaders, those memorable scenarios were almost always driven through an empowerment model. The recipe for those scenarios was always the same. My team and manager was being presented with a particular challenge and I would be asked to identify the solution and then execute on that solution. Minimal manager oversight and trust played key roles. I imagine my managers all experienced some level of anxiety in allowing me to own the solution, so how did they manage the risk?&rdquo; </p>

<h2>My 7 rules for remote-work sanity</h2>
<p class="author">By Mike Bursell

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;I work remotely, and have done, on and off, for a good percentage of the past 10-15 years. I&rsquo;m lucky that I&rsquo;m in a role where this suits my responsibilities, and in a company &ndash; Red Hat &ndash; that is set up for it. Not all roles &ndash; those with many customer onsite meetings, or those with a major service component &ndash; are suited to remote working, of course, but it&rsquo;s clear that an increasing number of organisations are considering having at least some of their workers doing so remotely.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Remote Workers Are Outperforming Office Workers--Here&#39;s Why</h2>

Also startling: The number of workers who say they do not have access to quiet places to do focused work is up by 13 percent.</p>

<h2>The Invention of Zero: How Ancient Mesopotamia Created the Mathematical Concept of Nought and Ancient India Gave It Symbolic Form</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Central to humanity&rsquo;s quest to grasp the nature of the universe and make sense of our own existence is zero, which began in Mesopotamia and spurred one of the most significant paradigm shifts in human consciousness &mdash; a concept first invented (or perhaps discovered) in pre-Arab Sumer, modern-day Iraq, and later given symbolic form in ancient India.</p>

<h2>Who Is Marcus Aurelius? Getting To Know The Roman Emperor</h2>
<p class="author">By Daily Stoic

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Agasicles, king of the Spartans, once quipped that he wanted to be &lsquo;the student of men whose son I should like to be as well.&rsquo; It is a critical consideration we need to make in our search for role models. Stoicism is no exception. Before we begin our studies we need to ask ourselves: Who are the people that followed these precepts? Who can I point out as an example? Am I proud to look up to this person? Do I want to be more like them?</p>
<p>And Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, born nearly two millennia ago (121 &ndash; 180), is a leader and example who provides a resounding yes.&rdquo; </p>
