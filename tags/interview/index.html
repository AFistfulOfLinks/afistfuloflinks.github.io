<h2>How I Got 4 Data Science Offers and Doubled my Income 2 Months after being Laid Off</h2>
<p class="author">By Emma Ding

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>During this unprecedented time with the pandemic, many are finding their careers affected. This includes some of the most talented data scientists with which I have ever worked. Having shared my personal experience with some close friends to help them find a new job after being laid off, I thought it worth sharing publicly. After all, this touches more than me and my friends. Any data scientist who was laid off due to the pandemic or who is actively looking for a data science position can find something here to which they can relate, and which I hope will ultimately offer hope in your job search.</p>

<h2>Kite Launches AI-Powered JavaScript Completions — Code Faster with Kite</h2>

    <p>The JavaScript ecosystem continually invents new frameworks and design patterns. These inventions make it a vibrant place to be, but it also creates the need to learn an ever-changing set of code patterns and APIs. Kite&rsquo;s deep learning models have learned all of these patterns, understand the context of your code, so Kite can predict chunks of code and put them in your completions.</p>

    <p>Marc is one of the most notable and influential figures in the history of the internet. We were lucky to have a wide ranging conversation with him on how he spends his time, how he tries to set goals for himself, how he reads so much, what keeps him so plugged in after all of these years and what he wants people to build.</p>

<h2>Seek the Challengers</h2>
<p class="author">By Shripriya Mahesh

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>People like that&mdash;I call them challengers&mdash;can often be the smartest people in the room. They question because they want to understand the logic and thinking behind ingrained cultural habits. They want to use their time well, and they want to make a big impact.</p>
