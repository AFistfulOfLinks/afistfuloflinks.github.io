<h2>Colossal Cave Adventure: Building and running 40-year-old code from the dawn of gaming</h2>
<p class="author">By Doug Tidewell

<p>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.<br>
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building<br>
and down a gully.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? If you&rsquo;re an old-school gamer, you&rsquo;ve probably seen these words hundreds of times. They&rsquo;re the starting point for Colossal Cave Adventure, the first major computer game. It was created in 1977 by Willie Crowther and Don Woods and quickly became a phenomenon in those pre-GUI, pre-Internet years. What helped the game spread from one data center to another was the fact that the source code was freely available.</p>
<p>The last version of the code from the original authors was written in 1995, and if you&rsquo;re like us, you're hearing this story and wondering where that code is now. With the encouragement and permission of the authors, open source pioneer Eric S. Raymond has ported the code to his GitLab account. In this article, we&rsquo;ll show you how to build and run that code.</p>

<h2>Dockerizing modern web apps</h2>
<p class="author">By Hendrik

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most websites these days are Single Page Applications (SPA for short) where a single entry file handles all routes that a user might visit. Swept up in the ongoing trend of hosting in the cloud you might find yourself needing to &ldquo;dockerize&rdquo; your SPA. That is to say wrap it inside a Docker image and run it as a container. In this post we will explore how we can get that done.</p>

<h2>The Career Management Secret I Wish I Had Known in My Twenties</h2>
<p class="author">By David Cancel

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I used to have these meetings with Dave Gerhardt (DG). Back then, DG was the only marketer and he had just joined the team, so I was explaining to him how he could set himself up to grow as the company was growing. And I said that what happens is, usually, if a company is growing quickly, if they&rsquo;re experiencing hypergrowth, that company will end up growing faster than the individual.</p>

<h2>Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.</h2>
<p class="author">By Kent C. Dodds

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I would much rather have 30 tests break all at once due to one bug because they're integration tests than have no tests break because I mostly unit tested and didn't consider testing a specific integration point.</p>
