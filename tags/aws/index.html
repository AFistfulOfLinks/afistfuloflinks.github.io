<h2>Deploying a Flask app using AWS</h2>
<p class="author">By Imran Khan

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In this blog we will create a basic Flask application and deploy this to the web using AWS Lambda. The application is a simple API that takes as input some user defined data and posts the output. The inputs will also be saved to a database using AWS RDS.</p>
<p>Our simple API will calculate the roots of a given quadratic equation. It will take as input three numerical values which represent the coefficients and calculate the values (if they exist). We will also add in a way to store a record of these values in a database.</p>

<h2>Empowered Product Teams</h2>

    <p>What are the skills and techniques used by the best product teams at the best product companies to solve hard technology problems? I love this topic, and between the various risks (value, usability, feasibility, and viability), the various forms of prototypes for tackling these risks, and the many qualitative and quantitative techniques for testing these prototypes, there is so much to say.</p>

<h2>How to Create Animated Graphs in Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Viviane

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Matplotlib and Seaborn are some nice libraries in Python to create great looking plots. But these plots are all static and it&rsquo;s hard to depict the change of data values in a dynamic and pleasingly looking way. How nice would it be if in you next presentation, video or social media post you can present development in the data by using a short video clip? And even better, you can still keep using Matplotlib, Seaborn or any other library that you like to use for your plots!</p>

<h2>Managing Performance When It’s Hard to Measure</h2>
<p class="author">By Jim Whitehurst

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Organizations of all kinds have long struggled to accurately measure the performance of individual members. The typical approach is to assess an individual&rsquo;s performance against a metric usually tied to whether or not they performed a task and the amount of output they generated by doing so. There&rsquo;s a lot riding on these assessments: everything from compensation increases and bonus payments to promotions. And as anyone who has ever given or received a traditional performance review knows, this process can be highly subjective &mdash; even in the most metrics-obsessed organizations.</p>
<p>But what about the kinds of jobs where measuring someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;output&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about counting the number of widgets they produced, but rather it&rsquo;s about how they managed a team or influenced others or helped people collaborate better? While it might be easy to measure someone&rsquo;s output on an assembly line, how do we decide how well a manager manages or a leader leads?</p>

<h2>Weak Supervision: A New Programming Paradigm for Machine Learning</h2>
<p class="author">By Alex Ratner, Paroma Varma, Braden Hancock, Chris Ré, and other members of Hazy Lab

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In recent years, the real-world impact of machine learning (ML) has grown in leaps and bounds. In large part, this is due to the advent of deep learning models, which allow practitioners to get state-of-the-art scores on benchmark datasets without any hand-engineered features. Given the availability of multiple open-source ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and an abundance of available state-of-the-art models, it can be argued that high-quality ML models are almost a commoditized resource now. There is a hidden catch, however: the reliance of these models on massive sets of hand-labeled training data.</p>

<h2>Why feedback, not metrics, is critical to DevOps</h2>
<p class="author">By Ranjith Varakantam

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most managers and agile coaches depend on metrics over feedback from their teams, users, and even customers. In fact, quite a few use feedback and metrics synonymously, where they present feedback from teams or customers as a bunch of numbers or a graphical representation of those numbers. This is not only unfortunate, but it can be misleading as it presents only part of the story and not the entire truth.</p>
<p>When it comes to two critical factors&mdash;how we manage or guide our teams and how we operate and influence the product that our teams are developing&mdash;few exceptional leaders and teams get it right.&quot; (</p>

<h2>Why Visionary Leadership Fails</h2>
<p class="author">By Nufer Yasin Ates, Murat Tarakci, Jeanine P. Porck, Daan van Knippenberg, and Patrick Groenen

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Visionary leadership is widely seen as key to strategic change. That&rsquo;s because visionary leadership does not just set the strategic direction &mdash; it tells a story about why the change is worth pursuing and inspires people to embrace the change. Not surprisingly, then, science and practice have a very positive view of visionary leadership as a critical leadership competency.</p>
<p>But our research finds that the positive impact of visionary leadership breaks down when middle managers aren&rsquo;t aligned with top management&rsquo;s strategic vision. This can cause strategic change efforts to slow down or even fail.</p>
