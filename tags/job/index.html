<h2>Essential quality of life terminal improvements</h2>
<p class="author">By Jess Unrein

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>If you're anything like me, you spend a lot of time in your terminal. I went an embarrassingly long time without customizing anything because I'm fundamentally lazy and didn't want to learn how. However! Improving your terminal experience through configuration is the much more efficient and lazy long term solution. A few minutes now saves you headaches later. Don't be like me and wait a couple years before getting with the program.&quot; (</p>

<h2>Reinventing Performance Management</h2>
<p class="author">By Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Everyone loves to hate performance evaluations, and with good reason: Research has shown them to be ineffective, unreliable and unsatisfactory for seemingly everyone involved. They consume way too much time, leave most workers deflated and feel increasingly out of step with reality. A once-a-year, backwards-looking conversation with the boss hardly fits our forward-looking, instantly updated world.</p>

<h2>The Coders Programming Themselves Out of a Job</h2>
<p class="author">By Brian Merchant

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In 2016, an anonymous confession appeared on Reddit: 'From around six years ago up until now, I have done nothing at work.' As far as office confessions go, that might seem pretty tepid. But this coder, posting as FiletOFish1066, said he worked for a well-known tech company, and he really meant nothing. He wrote that within eight months of arriving on the quality-assurance job, he had fully automated his entire workload. 'I am not joking. For 40 hours each week, I go to work, play League of Legends in my office, browse Reddit, and do whatever I feel like. In the past six years, I have maybe done 50 hours of real work.'</p>
