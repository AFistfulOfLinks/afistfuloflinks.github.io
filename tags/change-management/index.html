<h2>Azure Functions vs. AWS Lambdas</h2>
<p class="author">By Joe Petrakovich

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Have you gotten around to trying this &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; stuff out?</p>
<p>I recently had to scratch my own itch and put together a couple small utilities, one with an AWS Lambda, and the other with an Azure Function.</p>
<p>Have you wondered if one was better than the other?</p>
<p>The experiences were&hellip; similar, but also quite different, and thus I share a .NET developer&rsquo;s perspective of each.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Change management will make or break key technology rollouts</h2>
<p class="author">By Lee Congdon

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;IT organizations are getting better at change management, but there are still many that &ldquo;throw projects over the fence&rdquo; and expect adoption. In some cases, senior business partners accept or even promote this approach. Your enterprise may achieve some success with informal change management, but you&rsquo;ll never realize a project&rsquo;s full business value unless you have buy-in and engagement from the ultimate users. That requires change management.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned from a Little Bug</h2>

    <p>Did you notice the problem? Chris did. He courteously reported “possible typo on part 4: ‘back luck’?” Whereupon I fixed the bug. What are the lessons to be learned here? Lots, I think.</p>

<h2>Should You Become a Manager?</h2>
<p class="author">By Cap Watkins

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Since starting my own business as a leadership coach, I&rsquo;ve spoken with a lot of folks who are at a crossroads in their careers. Should they become a manager, or should they continue to pursue excellence in their craft? Are those paths mutually exclusive? If not, how can they do both?</p>
<p>For many, this can be a very nebulous, stressful decision. There are only a few people I&rsquo;ve spoken with who&rsquo;ve known without a shadow of a doubt which path they wanted to take (I was not one of them, surprisingly).</p>

    <p>I found this article very interesting, as it touches on writing automated tests for valid states only and not worry about states that theoretically would never be allowed by a function. What is your take? </p>

<h2>Who Are the Forgotten Greats of Science Fiction?</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Time is nobody&rsquo;s friend. Authors in particular can fall afoul of time&mdash;all it takes is a few years out of the limelight. Publishers will let their books fall out of print; readers will forget about them. Replace &ldquo;years&rdquo; with &ldquo;decades&rdquo; and authors can become very obscure indeed.</p>

<h2>Why Do Employees Resist Change?</h2>
<p class="author">By Paul Strebel

- Submitted by <a href="https://mirekdlugosz.com/" class="submitter">Miroslaw Dlugosz-Zalewski</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The scenario is all too familiar. Company leaders talk about total quality management, downsizing, or customer value. Determined managers follow up with plans for process improvements in customer service, manufacturing, and supply chain management, and for new organizations to fit the new processes. From subordinates, management looks for enthusiasm, acceptance, and commitment. But it gets something less. Communication breaks down, implementation plans miss their mark, and results fall short. This happens often enough that we have to ask why, and how we can avoid these failures.</p>
