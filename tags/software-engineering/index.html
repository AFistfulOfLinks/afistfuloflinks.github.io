<h2>A theorem of software engineering</h2>
<p class="author">By Bertrand Meyer

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;My aim is to popularize a result that is well known in the software engineering literature, going back to the early work of Barry Boehm [1], and explained with great clarity by Steve McConnell in his 2006 book on software cost estimation [2] under the name &ldquo;Shortest Possible Schedule&rdquo;. While an empirical rather than a logical result, I believe it deserves to be called a theorem (McConnell stays shy of using the term) because it is as close as we have in the area of software engineering management to a universal property, confirmed by numerous experimental studies.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>How to Learn</h2>

    <p>For the past several years, I've been thinking a lot about learning science, or the systematic investigation of how we learn. This was fueled by a switch in career trajectories after I graduated college towards software engineering.</p>

<h2>How to Tell Your Team That Organizational Change Is Coming</h2>
<p class="author">By Liz Kislik

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>From time to time, every leader has to deliver news that is hard for employees to hear. Even when businesses are doing well, organizational and structural change is to be expected, and acquisitions, reorganizations, or policy changes can affect people&rsquo;s jobs in ways that create feelings of fear, anger, or sorrow.</p>

<h2>Learning Rust</h2>
<p class="author">By Alexandru Ene

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>While I didn&rsquo;t post anything on my blog I have been working on a lot of fun projects in my spare time. Most notably, I have been learning Rust. Part of doing that resulted in a few neat side-projects that I will talk about here in more detail. This is mostly my journey on learning a new language, I am sure there are other ways, but this worked for me.</p>

<h2>Psychological Safety: Models and Experiences</h2>
<p class="author">By Fabio and Giulia Armani

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;This paper discusses psychological safety that refers to a climate in which people are comfortable being (and expressing) themselves. In particular, psychological safety is centrally tied to learning behavior, while it lowers transactions costs and reduces the need to monitor behavior.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend</h2>
<p class="author">By tef

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Every line of code written comes at a price: maintenance. To avoid paying for a lot of code, we build reusable software. The problem with code re-use is that it gets in the way of changing your mind later on. (&hellip;) Instead of building re-usable software, we should try to build disposable software.</p>
