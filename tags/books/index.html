<h2>10 Books That Will Blow Your Mind</h2>
<p class="author">By Ryan Holiday

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When was the last time you asked someone you admired for a book recommendation—or more specifically, for the book that changed their life? You hear smart people talking about books they’re reading or thinking about all the time, but do you make the effort to read them too? Or do they just sit on your mental to-do list or your Amazon “save for later” list, never to be read?</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Websites have become larger and more complex over the past few years, and users expect them to load instantaneously, even on mobile devices. The smallest performance drops can have big effects; just a 100ms decrease in page load time can drop conversions by 7%. With competitors just a click away, organizations wishing to attract and retain customers need to make web performance a priority. One relatively simple method of doing this is by using content delivery networks (CDNs).&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Behavior-Driven Development with Django and Aloe</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Imagine you are a Django developer building a social network for a lean startup. The CEO is pressuring your team for an MVP. The engineers have agreed to build the product using behavior-driven development (BDD) to deliver fast and efficient results. The product owner gives you the first feature request, and following the practice of all good programming methodologies, you begin the BDD process by writing a test. Next you code a bit of functionality to make your test pass and you consider your design. The last step requires you to analyze the feature itself. Does it belong in your app?</p>

<h2>Colossal Cave Adventure: Building and running 40-year-old code from the dawn of gaming</h2>

<p>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.<br>
Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building<br>
and down a gully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar? If you&rsquo;re an old-school gamer, you&rsquo;ve probably seen these words hundreds of times. They&rsquo;re the starting point for Colossal Cave Adventure, the first major computer game. It was created in 1977 by Willie Crowther and Don Woods and quickly became a phenomenon in those pre-GUI, pre-Internet years. What helped the game spread from one data center to another was the fact that the source code was freely available.</p>
<p>The last version of the code from the original authors was written in 1995, and if you&rsquo;re like us, you're hearing this story and wondering where that code is now. With the encouragement and permission of the authors, open source pioneer Eric S. Raymond has ported the code to his GitLab account. In this article, we&rsquo;ll show you how to build and run that code.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;One of the recurring things that come to bite me and my team is having a less experienced engineer or new joiner work completely alone on a project for weeks or months. We&rsquo;ve done this multiple times, and the results were always similarly dire. The engineer ends up building something slightly - or very - different than what we intended to. They took a lot longer to do it - and their morale was down, due to feeling lonely and unproductive this time. They did make mistakes, but did not have anyone give them feedback, to learn from it. Every time we sat down and did a retrospective on what to do different, next time, we agreed on the same thing: have someone to work with from the start.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Or something like that. You just want to be helpful.\</p>
<p>In reality, your instinct is the opposite of helpful. Startlingly, when you jump in to solve a problem as a manager, it&rsquo;s one of the biggest leadership mistakes you can make.</p>

<h2>Empowerment can be tricky!</h2>
<p class="author">By Jeremy West

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Within the past several weeks I've had the opportunity to mentor and be mentored on the topic of empowering your team while maintaining respect for RACI rules. When I look back at in my career at the times I felt most inspired by my leaders, those memorable scenarios were almost always driven through an empowerment model. The recipe for those scenarios was always the same. My team and manager was being presented with a particular challenge and I would be asked to identify the solution and then execute on that solution. Minimal manager oversight and trust played key roles. I imagine my managers all experienced some level of anxiety in allowing me to own the solution, so how did they manage the risk?&rdquo; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you're anything like me, you spend a lot of time in your terminal. I went an embarrassingly long time without customizing anything because I'm fundamentally lazy and didn't want to learn how. However! Improving your terminal experience through configuration is the much more efficient and lazy long term solution. A few minutes now saves you headaches later. Don't be like me and wait a couple years before getting with the program.&quot; (</p>

<h2>Goodbye, Clean Code</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Obsessing with &ldquo;clean code&rdquo; and removing duplication is a phase many of us go through. When we don&rsquo;t feel confident in our code, it is tempting to attach our sense of self-worth and professional pride to something that can be measured. A set of strict lint rules, a naming schema, a file structure, a lack of duplication.</p>

    <p>Imagine you are looking at your calendar and there is 1:1 session scheduled for 2 PM today. Maybe it is with your manager, or maybe you&rsquo;re a manager about to talk with someone who reports to you. So how do you feel? Happy? Anxious? Neutral? Thinking about losing your time, again? Spending your time well and proactively? Able to push things forward? Competing against&hellip;you don&rsquo;t even know what exactly? Complaining once more? Feeling excitement about sharing your recent achievements? Feeling awkward as you don&rsquo;t know what to say? Expecting to get and provide candid feedback?</p>
<p>You can certainly experience a whole mixture of emotions before, during, and after 1:1 meetings. And even if you think you do &ldquo;quite fine&rdquo; in this area and know how to have effective 1:1s, we think it could be at least a bit better at Red Hat!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Think about when a manager&rsquo;s helped skyrocket your growth&mdash;what did they do? Did they teach you a new skill? Did they give you hard feedback?</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, when I ask this question to groups of workshop attendees, people describe a time when a manager sponsored them for a visible (and often scary) stretch assignment. An assignment that these workshop participants didn&rsquo;t exactly know how to do, and it felt fairly high stakes&mdash;but their manager trusted they could do it, for some reason. This trust, and this stretchy project, helped them grow exponentially.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis in Python</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>According to Wikipedia:<br>
   In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.</p>
<p><br>
You can say that EDA is statisticians way of story telling where you explore data, find patterns and tells insights. Often you have some questions in hand you try to validate those questions by performing EDA.</p>

    <p>The long march to the boss&rsquo;s office to get evaluated&mdash;it&rsquo;s a moment we all dread. Performance reviews are awkward. They&rsquo;re biased.

    <p>I used to have these meetings with Dave Gerhardt (DG). Back then, DG was the only marketer and he had just joined the team, so I was explaining to him how he could set himself up to grow as the company was growing. And I said that what happens is, usually, if a company is growing quickly, if they&rsquo;re experiencing hypergrowth, that company will end up growing faster than the individual.</p>

    <p>In 2016, an anonymous confession appeared on Reddit: 'From around six years ago up until now, I have done nothing at work.' As far as office confessions go, that might seem pretty tepid. But this coder, posting as FiletOFish1066, said he worked for a well-known tech company, and he really meant nothing. He wrote that within eight months of arriving on the quality-assurance job, he had fully automated his entire workload. 'I am not joking. For 40 hours each week, I go to work, play League of Legends in my office, browse Reddit, and do whatever I feel like. In the past six years, I have maybe done 50 hours of real work.'</p>

<h2>The Evolutionary Mystery of Left-Handedness and What It Reveals About How the Brain Works</h2>
<p class="author">By Maria Popova

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The question of why some humans are left-handed &mdash; including such notable specimens as Plato, Charles Darwin, Carl Sagan, Debbie Millman, Stephen Jay Gould, Noam Chomsky, and Albert Einstein &mdash; has perplexed scientists for centuries. For Southpaws themselves &mdash; the affectionate term for lefties &mdash; this biological peculiarity has been everything from a source of stigma to a point of pride. But at the heart of it remains an evolutionary mystery</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It happens every year: With the turn of a calendar page comes a feeling of hope and opportunity, a renewed determination to tackle goals that have been on the back burner, plus some new ones for good measure. But then a month goes by, and then another, and that ambition slowly fades as you settle back into your ruts. And barring any huge change on the horizon, like a new job or a cross-country move, that&rsquo;s likely where you&rsquo;ll stay until a new year starts and the cycle repeats.</p>

Am I proud to look up to this person? Do I want to be more like them?</p>

<h2>Why Do Employees Resist Change?</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The scenario is all too familiar. Company leaders talk about total quality management, downsizing, or customer value. Determined managers follow up with plans for process improvements in customer service, manufacturing, and supply chain management, and for new organizations to fit the new processes. From subordinates, management looks for enthusiasm, acceptance, and commitment. But it gets something less. Communication breaks down, implementation plans miss their mark, and results fall short. This happens often enough that we have to ask why, and how we can avoid these failures.</p>
