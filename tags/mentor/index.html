<h2>Bit by Bit</h2>
<p class="author">By Nimisha Mukherjee

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>This year we decided to conduct a hackathon at the Bangalore Engineering office. We started with the idea of doing something around diversity and inclusion. We adopted the International Women's Day theme - #BalanceforBetter, as it resonated with Red Hat's Diversity &amp; Inclusion program. The only rule we applied was that we wanted the participating teams to have at least one woman on their team.</p>

<h2>How To Be A Mentor</h2>

    <p>In one of my previous <a href="https://dev.to/jamesmh/becoming-an-intermediate-developer-mh9">posts</a>, we looked at the career stage of being an intermediate developer.</p>
<p>One of the pieces of advice I gave was to find a mentor.</p>
<p>Today, I want to look at the flip-side of that topic: how to be a mentor!</p>

<h2>How to communicate effectively as a leader</h2>
<p class="author">By Joseph Gefroh

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/FJPhotography" class="submitter">Frank Jansen</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Many first-time leaders see their teams devolve into chaos and their effectiveness reduced by unnecessary friction.</p>
<p><br>
Because of their lack of experience, they resort to large, sweeping changes in their attempts to improve the effectiveness of their organizations and fulfill their vision.\</p>
<p>These herculean efforts fail over and over, while the real solution sits ignored in front of them: communicate better.</p>

<h2>How to Recruit in a Highly Competitive Job Market</h2>
<p class="author">By Jeff Moore

- Submitted by Michael Harvey

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re recruiting in a tight talent market, the goal isn&rsquo;t to have every candidate choose you over competitors. A candidate might be a poor match for your company but a great fit for a competitor.</p>
<p>Instead, handle the competition by highlighting your employer&rsquo;s brand, showing candidates what it&rsquo;s like to work at your company. Leave it to the candidate to decide what they want and determine if your company is the right fit. This will filter out the candidates who wouldn&rsquo;t be happy in the role, and will allow you to hire the person who genuinely wants to work at your company.</p>

<h2>What Mentors Wish Their Mentees Knew</h2>
<p class="author">By Vineet Chopra, MDSanjay Saint, MD

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The mentor-mentee relationship is a tango between a more senior person and a junior one. Just as in dance, coordination and orchestration between parties is necessary for grace and success. And while we and others have written about what makes the ideal mentor, comparatively less attention has been given to the other partner. This gap is unfortunate because, like mentorship, menteeship requires specific behaviors &mdash; without which the mentee&rsquo;s success may be threatened. In this article, we outline six habits of ideal mentees and provide anecdotes and views from our combined years of academic experience. While we focus on the relationship in academic medicine, the takeaways apply to most any field.&rdquo; </p>
