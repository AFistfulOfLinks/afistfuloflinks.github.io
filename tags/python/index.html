    <p>We all reach critical points in our lives where our mental strength is tested. It might be a toxic friend or colleague, a dead-end job, or a struggling relationship.

<h2>A Wall Calendar Will Change Your Life</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The act of putting pen to paper was like putting a mental sticky note in my mind; if I write something down, it&rsquo;s more likely to stick with me than if I type it into my phone. Beyond that, looking at my phone calendar has never been second nature, so during my calendar-less years, keeping up with events became more difficult. I knew about big things, work-related things, but I&rsquo;d occasionally, unintentionally, miss smaller coffee meetings or phone calls. I tried a day planner for a while, but transferring it from bag to bag just felt like a bother. &ldquo;Portable&rdquo; is overrated.</p>

<h2>Advice: What to do when you’re a woman and a man ignores you in a meeting</h2>

- Submitted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cswiii" class="submitter">Corey Welton</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A younger, male colleague and I were recently assessing a university unit as volunteers for a professional association. We met with two supervising faculty, an older man (Professor X) and a woman about my age. Throughout the meeting X angled himself toward my colleague, and rarely let the other woman answer any questions. At the end, he asked my colleague questions about his background, but did not ask me, a woman, about mine. What did I do to render myself invisible or less powerful? Does taking notes in a steno pad make me appear to be a secretary? I asked my share of questions, but not the first question. Was that a mistake? Was I right to just let it go and use it as a teachable moment with my students?</p>

    <p>I recently installed Ubuntu&rsquo;s package (for Ubuntu 20.04) of the Python netaddr on a system of ours. When I did, I got an interesting Python warning that I hadn&rsquo;t seen before: <code>SyntaxWarning: &quot;is not&quot; with a literal. Did you mean &quot;!=&quot;?</code> I was curious enough to look up the code in question.</p>

<h2>Another Side of-- Scott Fitzgerald?</h2>
<p class="author">By Sally Koslow

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Do you remember your first F. Scott Fitzgerald? How you realized there was something more to literature, a voice, a time, a glamor? And then you heard about Zelda, and the Jazz Age, and Gatsby, and the beautiful shirts? And thought about why Nick Carraway was named that, and what Scott&rsquo;s life was really like, and whether it would have been amazing or tragic?<br>
Sally Koslow explored, absorbed, researched and recreated&mdash;and brings us&mdash;lucky us&mdash;a wonderful narrative biography into one part of Scott Fitzgerald&rsquo;s life.</p>

<h2>asyncio: We Did It Wrong</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We&rsquo;re led to believe that we&rsquo;re able to do a lot with the structured async/await API layer. Some tutorials, while great for the developer getting their toes wet, try to illustrate real world examples, but are actually just beefed-up &ldquo;hello, world&quot;s. Some even misuse parts of asyncio&rsquo;s interface, allowing one to easily fall into the depths of callback hell. Some get you easily up and running with asyncio, but then you may not realize it&rsquo;s not correct or exactly what you want, or only gets you part of the way there. While there are tutorials that do to improve upon the basic Hello, World &ldquo;use&rdquo; case, often times, it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. It&rsquo;s often still just a web crawler. I&rsquo;m not sure about others, but I&rsquo;m not building web crawlers at Spotify.</p>

I had no idea what I was doing and had very little support. This is the survival guide I wish I had. It documents my experiences as an inexperienced team lead &ndash;as an engineer transitioning to a team lead&ndash; and my learnings &amp; mistakes along the way.

    <p><a href="http://www.developsense.com/blog/2019/01/breaking-the-test-case-addiction-part-1/">Last time out</a>, I was responding to a coaching client, a tester who was working in an organization fixated on test cases. Here, I&rsquo;ll call her Frieda. She had some more questions about how to respond to her managers.</p>
<p>What if they want another tester to do your tests if you are not available?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your tests&rsquo;, or &lsquo;your testing&rsquo;?&rdquo;, I asked.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve heard, your tests. I don&rsquo;t agree with this but trying to see it from their point of view, said Frieda.</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if we asked them &ldquo;What happens when you want another manager to do your managing if you are not available?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;What happens when you want another programmer to do programming if the programmer is not available?&rdquo; It seems to me that the last thing they would suggest would be a set of management cases, or programming cases. So why the fixation on test cases?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In Rapid Software Testing, we say that testing is evaluating a product by learning about it through exploration and experimentation, which includes questioning, modeling, studying, manipulating, making inferences, etc. So learning is an essential part of testing. There are lots of artifacts and people that testers could interact with to start learning about the product, which I&rsquo;ve discussed already. Let&rsquo;s look at why making a tester work through test cases might not be such a good approach.</p>

    <p>In the last installment, we ended by asking &ldquo;Once the tester has learned something about the product, how can you focus a tester&rsquo;s work without over-focusing it?</p>
<p>I provided some examples in Part 4 of this series. Here&rsquo;s another: scenario testing. The examples I&rsquo;ll provide here are based on work done by James Bach and Geordie Keitt several years ago. (I&rsquo;ve helped several other organizations apply this approach much more recently, but they&rsquo;re less willing to share details.)</p>
<p>The idea is to use scenarios to guide the tester to explore, experiment, and get experience with the product, acting on ideas about real-world use and about how the product might foreseeably be misused.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Within the past several weeks I've had the opportunity to mentor and be mentored on the topic of empowering your team while maintaining respect for RACI rules. When I look back at in my career at the times I felt most inspired by my leaders, those memorable scenarios were almost always driven through an empowerment model. The recipe for those scenarios was always the same. My team and manager was being presented with a particular challenge and I would be asked to identify the solution and then execute on that solution. Minimal manager oversight and trust played key roles. I imagine my managers all experienced some level of anxiety in allowing me to own the solution, so how did they manage the risk?&rdquo; </p>

    <p>&quot; Worlds of scarcity are made out of things. Worlds of abundance are made out of dependencies. That&rsquo;s the software playbook: find a system made of costly, redundant objects; and rearrange it into a fast, frictionless system made of logical dependencies. The delta in performance is irresistible, and dependencies are a compelling building block: they seem like just a piece of logic, with no cost and no friction. But they absolutely have a cost: the cost is complexity, outsourced agency, and brittleness. The cost of ownership is up front and visible; the cost of access is back-dated and hidden.&rdquo; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For an upcoming project, I need to extract level data from the classic 1985 video game Super Mario Bros (SMB). More precisely, I want to extract the background imagery for each stage of the game, excluding HUD elements and moving sprites, etc. Of course, I could just stitch together images from the game, and perhaps automate this process with computer vision techniques. But I think the method described below is more interesting, and allows for inspection of elements of the level perhaps not exposed through screenshots. </p>

    <p>We're several months into the work at the firm, and one very interesting concept has come to the fore: The implementation of preemptive change is about desire. Or, as one senior leader proffered at a recent executive steering committee meeting, &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it.&quot; I love this statement: &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it!&quot; It's a straightforward way to summarize an otherwise elegant management philosophy -- one that connotes desire, focus, and a commitment to change. In the interest of furthering this theory, let me propose five basic leadership principles we can use to form the backbone of the &quot;Ya' gotta wanna do it&quot; philosophy. </p>

<h2>How to Create Animated Graphs in Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Viviane

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Matplotlib and Seaborn are some nice libraries in Python to create great looking plots. But these plots are all static and it&rsquo;s hard to depict the change of data values in a dynamic and pleasingly looking way. How nice would it be if in you next presentation, video or social media post you can present development in the data by using a short video clip? And even better, you can still keep using Matplotlib, Seaborn or any other library that you like to use for your plots!</p>

<h2>How to design a RESTful API architecture from a human-language spec</h2>
<p class="author">By Filipe XimenesFlávio Juvenal

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Like almost all software, an API needs to reflect the needs of the humans who interact with it. An API is somewhat different from a GUI or other user interface because it interacts with a programmer rather than directly with the end user. However, the principles of designing for the user still apply: you must think of the background knowledge brought by the programmers and the constraints under which they are operating, such as the bandwidth of mobile devices.</p>

<h2>How to Recruit in a Highly Competitive Job Market</h2>
<p class="author">By Jeff Moore

- Submitted by Michael Harvey

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re recruiting in a tight talent market, the goal isn&rsquo;t to have every candidate choose you over competitors. A candidate might be a poor match for your company but a great fit for a competitor.</p>
<p>Instead, handle the competition by highlighting your employer&rsquo;s brand, showing candidates what it&rsquo;s like to work at your company. Leave it to the candidate to decide what they want and determine if your company is the right fit. This will filter out the candidates who wouldn&rsquo;t be happy in the role, and will allow you to hire the person who genuinely wants to work at your company.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Four years ago, I was coming back to work from my first maternity leave, and was working 3 days a week. Week after week, I kept my head down and got my coding tasks done in my limited time in the office.</p>
<p>Soon it became crystal clear to me that even if I did this incredibly well &mdash; as well as I possibly could &mdash; I wouldn&rsquo;t be given the opportunity to lead a team or to do more strategic work. I would just get more coding tasks assigned to me. At that point, I could see that what I was doing wouldn&rsquo;t get me to where I wanted, but I also didn&rsquo;t know what I should do instead. So here&rsquo;s the post I wish I had read then.</p>

<h2>In Defense of YAML</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm not against YAML, just against abuse of YAML. I want to help prevent people abusing YAML and being cruel to themselves and their coworkers in the process.</p>
<p>YAML's strength is as a structured data format. Yes, it has issues. Whitespace is a minefield. Its syntax is surprisingly complex. It has gotchas: &quot;Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway.&quot; But YAML is human readable and supports comments: two key benefits that drive its popularity.</p>
<p>Where it can go wrong is where we use YAML to describe behavior.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis in Python</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>According to Wikipedia:<br>
   In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.</p>
<p><br>
You can say that EDA is statisticians way of story telling where you explore data, find patterns and tells insights. Often you have some questions in hand you try to validate those questions by performing EDA.</p>

They stick us in boxes and leave us waiting far too long for feedback. It&rsquo;s no surprise that by the end of 2015, at least 30 of the Fortune 500 companies had ditched performance evaluations altogether. But let&rsquo;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Three years ago, Mark Russinovich, CTO ofAzure, Microsoft's cloud program, said, &quot;One in four [Azure] instances are Linux.&quot; Then, in 2017, it was 40 percent Azure virtual machines (VM) were Linux. Today, Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise group, said in an interview, &quot;it's about half now, but it varies on the day because a lot of these workloads are elastic, but sometimes slightly over half of Azure VMs are Linux.&quot; Microsoft later clarified, &quot;about half Azure VMs are Linux.</p>

<h2>Make a Kubernetes Operator in 15 minutes with Helm</h2>
<p class="author">By Rob Szumski

- Submitted by Vatsal Parekh

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl tooling.</p>
<p>This post will walk through making an Operator based on an existing Helm chart to show the value you can get through an Operator, without having to write any Go code, using the Helm Operator kit from the Operator Framework. Afterwards, we are going to compare and contrast this Helm-powered Operator vs a Go-based Operator.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>One of the most common steps in defining titles when a company is hitting its growth stage is adding &lsquo;Senior&rsquo; to the moniker of engineer but soon enough, especially if retention is good and people are staying on board a number of years, companies realize they need more than just a 2 level engineering ladder. This is where titles like &lsquo;principal&rsquo; or &lsquo;staff&rsquo; engineer become part of the defined career ladder. However, principal engineer should not be seen as a natural progression to senior engineering levels.</p>

Or maybe even do some crazy setup with symlinks and change what the <code>python</code> command points to. But a much better idea is to use a tool called pyenv.</p>

    <p>Considering their underlying technology, slot machines are intriguing test subjects. The software at the back end randomly generates the numbers and patterns of the winning combinations, and when you add currency processing into the mix, you have some interesting test cases. If you've ever wondered what goes into testing slot machines, read on.</p>

    <p>Towards the end of last year, I began working with a new team. Unlike most teams I&rsquo;ve worked with in recent years, the divide between the Developers and Testers was large and was causing much tension.

<h2>Rather Than a Micromanager or Absentee Manager, Be a Thought Partner</h2>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;We call managers who have low, almost non-existent involvement in their team&rsquo;s work absentee managers. Those with extremely (maybe excruciatingly) close involvement are micromanagers. And in between those are the thought partners, the ones who empower, enable and encourage their teams to do the best work of their lives. How can you determine where you fall on this spectrum so you can learn how to move in the right direction instead of being a micromanager or an absentee manager?</p>

    <p>A good software architecture allows decisions about frameworks, databases, web-servers, and other environmental issues and tools, to be deferred and delayed. A good architecture makes it unnecessary to decide on Rails, or Spring, or Hibernate, or Tomcat or MySql, until much later in the project. A good architecture makes it easy to change your mind about those decisions too. A good architecture emphasizes the use-cases and decouples them from peripheral concerns. </p>

<h2>SLOs Are the API for Your Engineering Team</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>If your job involves direct leadership of engineering teams, managing how and what they deliver, you&rsquo;ve surely come across situations where the pressure to deliver features won out and led to poor service reliability. You&rsquo;ve probably had your team&rsquo;s workflow disrupted by interference from senior managers about minor individual issues. Or, you&rsquo;ve seen or heard execs questioning your team&rsquo;s planned work to reduce technical debt or improve your delivery processes.</p>
<p>These kinds of clashes are extremely common between engineering teams and management, as well as among different engineering teams. They are all various manifestations of a single issue: the need for a better abstraction layer for people and teams who are trying to interact or collaborate with your team. That abstraction layer is called Service Level Objectives.</p>

    <p>We&rsquo;re often asked: &ldquo;Can employees at The Ritz-Carlton really spend $2,000 per day per guest?&rdquo; The answer is, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; At The Ritz-Carlton, everyone has $2,000/day per guest to make it right or delight, but the money is symbolic. No one is walking around with $2,000 in his or her pocket. However, from day one at your job, you&rsquo;re encouraged and empowered to fix or improve a guest&rsquo;s experience, and you may spend up to $2,000 to do this.</p>

<h2>The Shift-Left Approach to Software Testing</h2>
<p class="author">By Arthur Hicken

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The earlier you find out about problems in your code, the less impact they have and the less it costs to remediate them. Therefore, it's helpful to move testing activities earlier in the software development lifecycle&mdash;shifting it left in the process timeline. This article explores the shift-left methodology and how you can approach shifting left in your organization.</p>

<h2>The state of Python Packaging</h2>
<p class="author">By Bernat Gabor

- Submitted by Elijah DeLee

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>pip 19.0 has been released on 22nd January 2019. On the feature list most notably it now supports PEP-517, which by default is turned on when that the project has a pyproject.toml at the root folder. The PEP in question has been created in 2015 and accepted in 2017. Even though it took a while until pip implemented it, the release and the issues that followed it up confirmed that many people are not at all familiar with it. Read on if you want to get a picture of how the Python packaging ecosystem evolved as of today and where we hope to see it down the line. We hope even though the introduction of aforementioned python enhancement proposal may cause some discomfort at the moment, we will benefit from it in the long term.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I recently gave a workshop on &quot;TDD in Python with pytest&quot;, where I developed a very simple Python project together with the attendees following a TDD approach. It's a good way to introduce TDD, I think. I wrote each test together with the attendees, and then I left them the task of writing the Python code that passes the test. This way I could show TDD in action, introducing pytest features like the pytest.raises context manager or the use of assert while they become useful for the actual tests.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The mentor-mentee relationship is a tango between a more senior person and a junior one. Just as in dance, coordination and orchestration between parties is necessary for grace and success. And while we and others have written about what makes the ideal mentor, comparatively less attention has been given to the other partner. This gap is unfortunate because, like mentorship, menteeship requires specific behaviors &mdash; without which the mentee&rsquo;s success may be threatened. In this article, we outline six habits of ideal mentees and provide anecdotes and views from our combined years of academic experience. While we focus on the relationship in academic medicine, the takeaways apply to most any field.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Why I Left Management: the engineering technical track vs. management track</h2>
<p class="author">By Joy Ebertz

- Submitted by Eric Sammons

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When advancing in an engineering career, at some point, the question will come up of if you&rsquo;re interested in the technical track or the management track. Different people thrive on different tracks and many people move back and forth between the two, some of them multiple times. While at many companies, good engineers are promoted to become engineering managers, the jobs are actually very different, and it&rsquo;s worth considering what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into and if it&rsquo;s a position in which you can thrive. As I made the transition into management and ultimately back, I learned some things about myself and how I operate.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mocking is a powerful technique for isolating tests from undesired interactions among components. But often people find their mock isn&rsquo;t taking effect, and it&rsquo;s not clear why. Hopefully this explanation will clear things up.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Working the Weekly 1:1</h2>
<p class="author">By Christina Wodtke

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;There are a lot of work &ldquo;rituals&rdquo; that suck so badly you want to hunt down and interrogate who ever invented them. The dreaded weekly status email is one of them. The weekly 1:1 between a boss and a direct report can be another. What should be a chance to get on the same page with the person critical to your success is often awkward, overly chummy or even skipped.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Working With JSON Data in Python</h2>
<p class="author">By Lukas Lofaro

<blockquote>
    <p>Since its inception, JSON has quickly become the de facto standard for information exchange. Chances are you&rsquo;re here because you need to transport some data from here to there. Perhaps you&rsquo;re gathering information through an API or storing your data in a document database. One way or another, you&rsquo;re up to your neck in JSON, and you&rsquo;ve got to Python your way out.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is a pretty common task, and&mdash;as with most common tasks&mdash;Python makes it almost disgustingly easy. Have no fear, fellow Pythoneers and Pythonistas. This one&rsquo;s gonna be a breeze!</p>

Making decisions quickly allows us to move quickly. We need to know which decisions we have to make, and have them presented for easy deciding</p>

<h2>Yes, You Should Estimate Software Projects</h2>
<p class="author">By Gergely Orosz

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;I hear more voices saying there is little point in doing time-based estimations on how long building software will take, and thus we should just stop doing it. &quot;Let's just use story points and estimate complexity, but not the time&quot; and &quot;Let's just try #noestimates&quot; are suggestions people around me recently brought up. I'm personally skeptical of both approaches. While I do think that doing time-based estimates is really hard, it comes with so many benefits for those who keep doing it.&rdquo; </p>

    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I said it. You don&rsquo;t have to spend 4+ years and thousands of dollars to become a software developer. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s bad for you to do this. Everyone forges their own path. I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s not necessary, and here&rsquo;s why.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Your Professional Growth Questionnaire</h2>
<p class="author">By &#34;Rands&#34;

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>For many of the companies I&rsquo;ve worked at for the past three decades, performance season is three weeks once a year. More progressive companies have a major performance cycle per year with a minor one six months after the major to capture one-off promotions for exceptional, errors in job leveling at hiring, and other performance housekeeping tasks that can&rsquo;t wait another six months.</p>
