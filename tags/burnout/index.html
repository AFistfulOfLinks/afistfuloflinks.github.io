<h2>A Gentle Introduction to Mutation Testing with PITest and Kotlin</h2>
<p class="author">By João Farias

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Code Coverage, although important, is not sufficient for giving good feedback of the changes developers implement. Mutation Testing tackle this problem in a systematic way, by applying changes heuristically and validating the suite of checks reaction to them.</p>

<h2>Closing the stress cycle</h2>
<p class="author">By Dan Pupius

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The most efficient way to close the stress cycle is physical activity. Walking, running, cycling, dancing, whatever. The second most effective method is breathing exercises. Box breathing, for example, allows CO2 to build up which stimulates the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic system, producing a calm and relaxed feeling. And the third way is positive social interactions and laughter.</p>

<h2>Demystifying Burnout in Tech</h2>
<p class="author">By parallaxbat

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The good news is that there <em>are</em> things we can do to both address and prevent burnout. Where we go wrong is a failure to recognize that burnout comes in many different flavors, each of which necessitates its own solution.</p>

<h2>How I learned about burnout the hard way</h2>
<p class="author">By Jason Hibbets

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In early 2017, I was mentally in a bad spot. It was the perfect storm of stress, the kind that no one asks for, but you deal with the hand you're dealt. Work was piling up to a point where I couldn't process all the things that were expected of me. I was training for spring half-marathons, which should have been stress relief, but I was putting too much pressure on myself to perform at a high level. And then on top of the everyday family obligations, a surgery in our household turned us into a one-car family and seriously added to the mounting pressure on me to provide and take care of the family. Then I broke. </p>

<h2>Practical Python Programming</h2>
<p class="author">By David Beazley -

- Submitted by Jake Callahan

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When I first learned Python nearly 25 years ago, I was immediately struck by how I could productively apply it to all sorts of messy work projects. Fast-forward a decade and I found myself teaching others the same fun. The result of that teaching is this course&ndash;A no-nonsense treatment of Python that has been actively taught to more than 400 in-person groups since 2007. Traders, systems admins, astronomers, tinkerers, and even a few hundred rocket scientists who used Python to help land a rover on Mars&ndash;they&rsquo;ve all taken this course. Now, I&rsquo;m pleased to make it available under a Creative Commons license. Enjoy! </p>

<h2>Production Oriented Development</h2>
<p class="author">By Paul Osman

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Throughout my career, I&rsquo;ve developed some opinions. Some have worn particularly deep ruts, reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these had in common, and it&rsquo;s the idea that code in production is the only code that matters. Staging doesn&rsquo;t matter, code on your laptop doesn&rsquo;t matter, QA doesn&rsquo;t matter, only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<h2>The Paradox of Scale</h2>
<p class="author">By David Carboni

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>There are a bunch of heroes in the digital world that are held up as aspirational examples in conversations about digital business, technology and ways of working. Netflix, Spotify, Uber, Amazon and a host of our favourite characters, but these myths can become damaging fictions.</p>

<h2>The Thing About Burnout</h2>
<p class="author">By Ashley McNamara

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Burnout has been a hot topic in both the open source community and broader tech industry, but too often these discussions simply acknowledge that burnout exists. We can do better. The care and feeding of ourselves is a start, but how about the care and feeding of our community?</p>

<h2>When to use the Clean Architecture?</h2>
<p class="author">By Sebastian Buczyński

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>There are few possible reactions after learning about the Clean Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture (AKA Ports &amp; Adapters) or even merely innocent service layer in Django. Some developers are enthusiastic and try to apply these techniques immediately, some are hesitant, full of doubts. The rest is strongly opposing, declaring openly this is an abomination. (...) What two extremes fail to do, is to ask the right question &ndash; WHEN? <strong>When the Clean Architecture should be used?</strong> </p>
