<h2>Continuous Improvement: How It Works and How to Master It</h2>
<p class="author">By James Clear

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The typical approach to self-improvement is to set a large goal, then try to take big leaps in order to accomplish the goal in as little time as possible. While this may sound good in theory, it often ends in burnout, frustration, and failure. Instead, we should focus on continuous improvement by slowly and slightly adjusting our normal everyday habits and behaviors.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Linux now dominates Azure</h2>
<p class="author">By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Three years ago, Mark Russinovich, CTO ofAzure, Microsoft's cloud program, said, &quot;One in four [Azure] instances are Linux.&quot; Then, in 2017, it was 40 percent Azure virtual machines (VM) were Linux. Today, Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise group, said in an interview, &quot;it's about half now, but it varies on the day because a lot of these workloads are elastic, but sometimes slightly over half of Azure VMs are Linux.&quot; Microsoft later clarified, &quot;about half Azure VMs are Linux.</p>

<h2>The Singleton Pattern</h2>
<p class="author">By Brandon Rhodes

- Submitted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OgMaciel" class="submitter">Og Maciel</a>

</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Python programmers almost never implement the Singleton Pattern as described in the Gang of Four book, whose Singleton class forbids normal instantiation and instead offers a class method that returns the singleton instance. Python is more elegant, and lets a class continue to support the normal syntax for instantiation while defining a custom __new__() method that returns the singleton instance. But an even more Pythonic approach, if your design forces you to offer global access to a singleton object, is to use The Global Object Pattern instead.&rdquo; </p>
